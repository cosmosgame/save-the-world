    <description>Save The World Books This is a list of the books that have a plan to save the world. There are surprisingly few of them. Most are not well known.&#xA;Community Peter Block works with communities to help them find their voice and power. This book is a guide to what seems to work the best. Val Hammel is using this as a guide to how she can revitalize HAI and make it flourish. She thinks the way to save the world is to rebuild our communities. I strongly agree with her.</description>
