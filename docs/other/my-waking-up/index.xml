    <title>My Waking Up</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/other/my-waking-up/index.html</link>
    <description>This is an essay I wrote back in my 40’s. It describes my path away from atheism, and into a deeper truth that doesn’t discard any part of me. I discovered that Reason and Spirit are equally important parts of the bigger Truth.</description>

      <description>“I can’t quite explain why, but I know what he is saying is not true”. We were sitting in a grassy courtyard surrounded by the dark-grey University of Chicago walls. Grey, grey minds always peering down at you was how a friend described the walls, but it was sunny and we were sitting on a park bench looking at the surprisingly pretty, purple-grey pigeons hop around on the grass. We had just gotten out of class, and for some reason this brilliant young woman was taking me into her confidence. The class was a small freshman seminar based on the Great books. At the moment we were studying Immanuel Kant, a genius philosopher, who had written a book arguing very persuasively that morality could be explained entirely on the basis of rational, logical rules. He was saying, in other words, that any moral decision can be decided if you just think rationally enough about it. I had found myself persuaded, but this young woman was not, and that is what we were talking about.</description>

      <description>How do I know what is true and what is false? This is a surprisingly deep question, and surprisingly few people ever think much about it. Or then again, perhaps it isn’t surprising. Whether we are aware of it or not we all have mental machinery humming along that helps us make the countless choices we need to make. Most of us instinctually recognize that messing with this machinery might cause a person’s life to break down. Indeed, I have seen it happen – people can literally think themselves into craziness. But on the other hand not understanding how we make decisions leaves us helpless to our own machinery. Your unconscious machinery might have problems, and sometimes, like in the case of the young woman choosing to live or die this makes a great deal of difference. If we want to lead a deep, rich fulfilling life it is necessary to make sure that our underlying assumptions (our mechanism) is sound. And one of the key assumptions that we need to examine is how we sort data into knowledge - how do we decide if we believe something is true or not?</description>

      <title>Flaming Intellectual</title>

      <description>But I didn’t know all this when I was sitting back there on that picnic bench at U. of C. It took a long personal journey before I learned to trust other sources of knowledge other than pure reason. To most people this is hardly a discovery - my wife laughs that I was ever in doubt about it. But, I wish someone would have explained this to me when I was younger. Up until this crisis of faith I had been a strict rationalist; Spock was my role model. In short, I was a nerd. I could literally spend all day wrapped up in abstract though, and I loved every second of it. This wasn’t, unfortunately, something I could share with most people. My high school was an inner-city, working class school. Intellectuals were not well tolerated, and I kept my love of ideas fairly well hidden. But I also lived in another world as well, the world of sports. Once, while I was on the football team, I got tired of waiting for the bus. It seemed like we were always waiting in the pseudo military that was football. One day, throwing caution to the wind, I pulled out a trashy sci-fi book (for some reason I thought it would help that the book was trashy) to read. Friends on the team came over to check in with me sincerely worried that there might be something wrong - they were really, touchingly concerned. The next day the coach accosted my father in the hallway (my father worked as the music supervisor for the district), and said in the bluff joking jock style “Do you know what the hell your son was doing the other day?!? He was reading!!, That’s what. What the hell has gotten into him!!?”. He was half serious. My worst fears were confirmed.</description>

      <title>Limits of Reason</title>

      <description>In class we studied how formal reasoning works. It turns out that any formal reasoning system starts out with basic assumptions (called axioms) and works up from there. No useful logical system can be built without these assumptions, but these assumptions have to be taken on faith - they are outside of the system. So many arguments are pointless because the participants are starting with radically different assumptions. Given how enormously important our assumptions are, it is shocking how unaware we typically are of them. When I talk about our mental machinery this is a major component.</description>

      <description>In my thirties I ended up in a lot of pain. I longed for a release from this pain, and on a subconscious level suicide might even have been starting to look attractive. At least it all would be over then. I tried talk therapy, but was deeply unimpressed with that method, although it seems to have worked for others. Then I stumbled onto some mildly radical personal growth seminars. I absolutely loved them. It turned out that I had some work to do - my mental machinery needed some fixing. The classes revealed to me how much I feared others. I had on a deep level just assumed everyone was out to hurt me. So I experimented with giving myself permission to connect to others on a deeper level and found pure joy! I also found out that many people’s struggles were in fact mine as well. And then I started on the hard work of changing the beliefs and assumptions that were getting in the way. I gradually became aware of a voice that was constantly tearing me down and even punishing me. I battled to love myself instead of hate myself. One practice I used was to look in the mirror at my acne-scarred face and say from the heart, “I love you”. To this day, every time I have a painful, negative thought about myself I habitually remind myself, “I have value”, and touch my hand to my heart. This may not sound like much, but it has been of enormous help to me. An acquaintance that knew me both before and after I had done this work said that, “You look a lot more comfortable in your skin now” - that describes it nicely.</description>

      <title>Other States</title>

      <description>Before I talked about Descartes’ (and my) assumption that the rational mind is the center and everything else, including our bodies, revolves around it. I now believe just the opposite - it is our bodies that are the center and everything else, including our rational minds, revolves around the body. The proof for this statement is not in thinking about it rationally, but to instead introspect and remember the states that you have been to, and to at least be open to the possibility of finding other states. But what are these other states that I keep on talking about? Ultimately this is something that you will have to discover in yourself. Here are some of the states that I have directly experienced:</description>

      <description>Life is a rich and varied banquet. Rationalists that stay safe in only their rational minds are missing out on the full richness of being human. When I try to talk about this with my rationalist friends it is somewhat frustrating - I end up basically saying, yes, pizza is one of my favorite foods too, but there is so much else out there as well, why not do a little more exploring?</description>

      <description>Gödel Escher Bach By Douglas R. Hofstadter&#xA;If you feel like exploring your rational mind, this is definitely the book for you. This is the best book I’ve seen for explaining the rational method. Amongst his other themes Hofstadter does a great job of explaining Goedel’s theorem. The Multi Orgasmic Couple By Mantak Chia and Maneen Chia, Douglas Abrams and Rachel Abrams.&#xA;In very down to earth practical terms shows how both men and women can focus their minds and bodies to achieve multiple orgasms. Then goes on to show how partners can share that energy. If you have your doubts about sex being a spiritual exercise, try this book.</description>
