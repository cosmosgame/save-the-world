Both were exploring all the stages of human development from the highest and lowest. Clare Graves’s health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues Don Beck and Chris Cowan. They took Grave’s original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus. I don’t cover his variations because my focus is more on the group than the individual. That was Don Beck’s focus as well. He made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid. Later on he tried the same thing with Israel and Palestine. He saw how this theory could transform the world. It is that focus that I am most interested in here.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Beige FirstAwakening Family and Kin My family In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow had the first awakening. We stepped into a higher stage of consciousness. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says “Dad, what is that?”, And the dad says, “I don’t know. We call it the moon” And both feel the awe and wonder of the world. This is where it all started. We have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don’t know when we started to use language and when we first awoke to I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Using imagination we could now travel into the future and the past.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Purple KinSpirits Tribe The sacred ground Something amazing happened about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across all of the planet. And where ever we spread, populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Red PowerGods Kingdoms, Empire My king. Honor This is the stage of empire. The strong ruled over the weak. We are taught to venerate Rome, but by today’s standards it was a hopelessly evil slave empire. It was very Red. Rulers the world over declared themself as God. The Pharoahs built their pyramids and other rulers demanded that their followers commit suicide when they died. And people willingly followed them into death. This is the stage of the Alexander The Great and Genghis Khan. Alexander is remembered as a “great” man, but by today’s standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. He probably killed his father to gain power. He killed a lot of other people just for the glory of it. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and Alexander (and their legions of followers) did not consider themselves evil. They considered themselves the good guys. And you have to kind of marvel at their martial excellence.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Blue TrueBlue Church,Schools The Truth There is a Truth that is eternal and greater than us. This is what we wake up to in the Blue stage. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was localized. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Might makes right. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Orange StriveDrive Capitalism, Democracy, and Science Give me liberty or give me death The Japanese were confronting the technological results of The Age of Enlightenment. This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America’s Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:&#xA;“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Yellow SecondAwakening Integral Theory, personal growth movement, medicine movement A life worth living At some point we need to turn back to ourselves to find the Truth of things. We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we are not at peace with ourselves. Green by itself won’t get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won’t heal the world. People insist on going their own selfish ways no matter how patiently we explain to them how crazy and evil they are. Then we try a little louder and slower, like you might to someone who does not speak English well. You. are. crazy. And. Evil! Huh. How can they not understand that?!? Why don’t they understand how crazy and evil they are?!? Maybe we are missing something? Perhaps there is a deeper stage to go here? Maybe just maybe there is something more workable than dividing the world up into good and evil? But to convince you of that I need for you to go very deeply into yourself. Kind of like an odyssey of the soul. It can be a bit scary and painful, but there is also wonder and joy. It feels like Odysseus tied to his ship’s mast finally surrendering, cutting his ropes, and jumping off to join the Sirens. Giving up this life so that he can know what worlds come after.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Turqoise PromisedLand Just starting to emerge Save the world After finding our vast strength in Yellow we start to really open up to all that is. And it hurts. Really hurts. The world is suffering in so many needless ways. Before when we met this pain we ran away, but now we start to realize how truly big we are. We are more than just our narrow individual ego. We are part of something so so much bigger. Big enough even to face that scary tidal wave of world pain. We are all one. When you suffer, I suffer too. We now start to really get that. And it is so not OK what is happening. Just finding our own joy is no longer enough. The deeper joy is the joy of all. This puts us in a really big, strong place. Standing in this place of strength we now cast our gaze outwards. And a wild, crazy hope emerges. On our own there is relatively little we can do. But together? Together we can change the world.</description>
