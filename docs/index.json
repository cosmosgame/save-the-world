	"content": " “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\nAlbert Einstein.\nWelcome! Thank you so much for visiting this website! Your support and feedback is so vital \u0026ndash; it will help me create something of value. I won\u0026rsquo;t get there without you. Truly.\nI want a plan to save the world. A plan that might actually work. A plan that addresses all of the needless suffering of the world. Ecological collapse, racism, sexism, genocide \u0026ndash; all of it. Coming up with a shared plan is my deepest desire. When I tell people this they tend to recoil back \u0026ndash; whoah! way too big! Is that your reaction too? To be completely honest I also feel like that at times. It seems so overwhelming \u0026ndash; who am I to even bring this up? But why are we so quick to assume it is impossible? Maybe because we tend to hold ourselves as small, helpless, and separate. It is kind of like a trance we are walking around in. But we can shake off that trance. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. It really doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nI used to think that this is someone else\u0026rsquo;s work to do, not mine. No longer. I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting my whole life for someone else to rescue us. It took me that long to finally realize this is my work too. And actually people have been hard at work all that time. They have done so much and yet here we are. On our own we can only get so far. We need a movement that brings us together. Because together we are strong. Strong enough to heal this hurting world. We still need people fighting like hell for things like emissions reductions, Black Lives Matter, and Social Justice. That work doesn\u0026rsquo;t go away. But even as we do that vitally important work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream \u0026ndash; saving the world together.\nThis site is a home for this bigger dream. For big problems like this we need the collective intelligence and wisdom of as many people as we can get. This site is set up to encourage and enable people to collaborate. Because we have work to do. We need to come up with something very new. To paraphrase Einstein, you can not solve problems with the same consciousness that created them. We need to step into a much bigger consciousness.\nThe situation is quite scary and there are excellent reasons why we might choose to stay in the comforting trance of helplessness. But there is too much at stake now. My teenage daughter recently asked me if the future is secure enough for her to have children someday. Ouch. Truly ouch. What a question. At the time we were talking about global warming, but the question brings in so much more than that. I had to really think about it. Getting to the truth is really important here, but it is so hard. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asked what about her children\u0026rsquo;s children? And what about all future children? What kind of world are we passing on to them? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nMy first grandson was born recently, and I am so grateful to now be a grandfather. I find my focus as grandfather is now less on myself and more towards the health of the tribe. And it is not looking so good. The reports on global warming are now so bad I no longer can read them. We are blasting past the temperature that scientists thought might let us continue on as somewhat normal. That is no longer going to happen. Now we will have to adapt to a very different climate and we already have failed our first tests. Syria collapsed in large part because of climate change droughts and sent desperate immigrants to Europe. Those immigrants sparked the rise of authoritarian parties in Europe demanding racial purity. Drought in Guatemala forced people to flee to the U.S. and helped fuel the rise of MAGA anti-immigration craziness. Intolerance and hate are on the rise all over the world. These things are connected. And the climate is only going to get worse from here. If we don\u0026rsquo;t start helping and caring for each other it could start a cascading failure where one thing leads to the next and then billions of people die. That is a very real possibility.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pause here. I know it might seem like a weird question, but where do you feel all of this in your body? As I wrote this I felt pain in my stomach and a strong tension in my neck and shoulders. That\u0026rsquo;s fear. I\u0026rsquo;m scared. Really scared and it hurts. It is hard to just sit with this pain. Up to now I have had lots of strategies to push off the pain. I made it someone else\u0026rsquo;s problem. I let myself off the hook by going to helplessness. Nothing I can do, not my fault. But now I\u0026rsquo;m holding my grandson in my lap — he is the world to me — and thinking about what kind of world he is going to live in. All my evasions are no longer good enough. I see them for what they are. And actually I am grateful for them. They have kept me from getting crushed with anxiety. Stepping out from their protection feels tremendously vulnerable. And it is completely OK for you to have your own armor. I don\u0026rsquo;t want you crushed by the weight of all this. Please protect yourself. And yet I am asking you to lower your armor just a tiny bit. Asking you to, what Brenee Brown calls embrace the suck of vulnerabilityat least a little.\nBecause disaster is not inevitable. Even as some farming areas fail others like Siberia might open up. We probably can grow enough food for everyone, but only if we learn to share. Learn to get past all that othering and truly love each other. But that is going to require a massive cultural change that requires everyone. It requires even someone as ordinary as me. It requires even you. Opening up to this hope and caring is tremendously vulnerable. It is an enormous ask. I can\u0026rsquo;t promise you won\u0026rsquo;t get hurt, but please know it feels so much better to directly face the fear together than alone. With all my heart I want my daughter to have children if that is what she wants. Her children will help heal this world. But they are going to need our help.\nHow do we give her children the tools they will need? We first need to investigate the deeper causes of our problems. What prevents us from opening our hearts wider and wider? What would it take on a practical level to save the world? I have been looking for answers. And they are out there! Many people have such important things to teach us. Now we need to bring these separate teachings together into an integrated whole. First we must awaken these teachings in ourselves because of course it has to start there. That is the ground we must stand on. But once we are standing in that place of strength we can then look out to others and ask, \u0026ldquo;What is it that we want to create together?\u0026rdquo;\nApparently, the best way to get an answer to a question on the internet is to answer the question wrong. That provokes people to correct you. It is quite amusing, but it seems to work. So in that spirit I am going to provide my own answer to the question. If you have a better solution \u0026ndash; great! you have no idea how eager I am to hear it.\nWhat do we need to make the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible?\nA Better Story We need a better story. We forget how much our stories define us. Our stories tells us where we came from and what it is we are to do in this world. Right now our collective story holds us as very small. It tells us there is nothing we can do. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like that. We can choose to tell ourselves a very different story. A story that gives us courage. A story that lets us shake off this trance of helplessness and take on the task of saving the world with a heart full of passion. The right story will provide us hope. Hope that something huge might just want to awaken soon.\nWider Healing When I am hurting, my personal world collapses down. All I can manage is just to make it through the day. I can\u0026rsquo;t take on anything beyond that. And collectively the world is hurting. Most people are in too much pain to do the bigger work. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like that. It is not hopeless. Therapy can really help, and there have been some exciting, recent breakthroughs that make it even better. We need to spread this healing to everyone that needs it. When people emerge out of pain, incredible things happen.\nBeyond that there are potent workshops and teachings that can help us step into happiness, even joy. We need to teach people how to find it in themself and then how to teach it to others. It is from this place of joy that we will heal the world.\nUnity consciousness We feel separate and lonely. We feel helpless and small facing the problems of the world. But that is just a story we keep telling ourselves. In fact we are big, very big. But to get there we need to embrace all of ourselves. Not just the comfortable parts that get approval from others, but the darker hurting places as well. They need love too. Especially those parts. And when we embrace all of ourself it becomes possible to embrace all others. Even the ones that have hurt us. Even the ones that scare us and make us crazy angry. The more we can have deep compassion for ourselves, darkness and all, the more we can have compassion for others, darkness and all.\nWe are not alone! This work is going to take everyone. We need programmers and poets, accountants and artists, bankers and bakers. We think this work belongs to others not us. We await the next messiah, someone who is more qualified or capable than us. It can’t work that way. All of our voices are precious and needed. Each one is a gift, and when joined all together will create a beautiful, world changing song.\nA Bigger Dream It is time to dream a bigger dream. Our way of living does not work. This calls for change. Radical change. We all know what needs to be done; we just are struggling to believe it possible. But imagine us coming together as a loving, supportive, wise tribe. That will be the core of it. It will feel electric and right when it happens. People will flock to it because it is so much fun.\nTogether, we will start telling ourselves a different story. That this could actually work. Work well enough that maybe we can start to dream a far bigger dream. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not? It has always been possible to save the world, we just need to wake up from this trance and do it.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?\nTo care? I think I do know what I\u0026rsquo;m asking of you. Please join me anyways.\n"

	"content": "It is easy to forget the real gifts that come with Orange. For example we need to replace capitalism, but first recognize how well it sometimes works. It has brought us to the brink (and maybe past) of disaster, but it also has brought us so much wealth and possibilities. Capitalism relies on the The Wisdom of Crowds. It harnesses the creative forces of many individual actors acting alone to capture their collective wisdom. We do need to establish (Blue) rules to ensure a functioning marketplace, but then we can step back and let the market do its magic. We need better batteries? Let the competition begin. Solar power slowly and surely went from one of the most expensive sources of power until now it is the cheapest. And it is going to get even cheaper still. Much of that was due to market forces. Democracy works in the same way. We assume that many people voting their self interest is the best way to govern. Astonishingly it seems to sort of work. As Churchill said, \u0026ldquo;democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "At the very start of my sophomore year in high school I woke up from a really clear dream. I don’t usually remember my dreams and it is even more rare that they have a clear message so this felt like a big deal. The dream was clearly telling me to join the football team. I hadn’t played football my freshman year and I had already missed out on the summer training session so they were reluctant to even let me on. I was allowed to practice, but not even given full equipment. Everyone was quite skeptical of me, heck, I was skeptical of me. As I’ve said I don’t exactly identify as a typical male. But I just knew that I needed to be there.\nI turned out to be a very good player — I was even a star that year. And I loved playing. My secret was to put myself into a kind of berserker rage before games. This “rage” allowed me to play way beyond my normal physical limits.I could run faster and leap way farther. It felt like a kind of insanity but it was delicious. I could just smash through that line and sack the quarterback. Any one who describes anger as a “negative” emotion has not known this joy. If you haven’t felt the joy of anger you are missing out.\nI was effective enough that I was made nose guard on the defense. That meant that instead of just protecting one lane I had the honor of controlling the lanes on either side of the center. The center is the one who hikes the ball, and that distracts them for a second, so if you are fast enough and ruthless enough you can take him out of action. That freed up the defense to have more defenders elsewhere. It was an honor to be made nose guard and I was very proud of my role.\nUntil one night the team got together and the coach played the tapes for the previous game. And in the middle of it we saw a player being helped off the field with something very wrong with his neck. It was the other team’s center. In order to be a good nose guard I needed to be ruthless. I needed to smash that center as hard as I could to take him out of action. That was the only way to control two lanes. And in my berserker rage I hadn’t even noticed that harm I’d done. He was just a barrier to get through. Watching how hurt he was I was horrified. That was me?!? But it got worse, my team started to clap and chant my name calling me killer.\nI’m crying as I write this. Even after all these years it still hurts so much. I loved those guys. I loved being on the team. Which made it so much worse. I was already reeling internally at what I had done but to be celebrated for it? That was so, so much worse. It felt like a betrayal. I’ve had a lifelong struggle to trust men after that. And you know what? That struggle to love men’s darkness and all is exactly, and I mean this in an almost pure, mathematical sense, exactly the same work as learning to love myself darkness and all. Because the naked truth is that sometimes when we step into our great power we create great harm. We just do. And my personal reaction was to step back from power. No way — I don’t want to be the source of harm.\nAnd yet.\nThis world desperately needs warriors to stand up to fight injustice and oppression. We need our warriors. Yes, they have to be pointed in the right direction — we will get to that later — but first we need people to step up. Even me. Even you. We especially need people who are horrified at the prospect of causing harm. We have good reasons for holding back. The danger is very, very real. But please consider. We are ceding the ground to people who are either clueless or just don’t care about the damage they are causing. That can’t work.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Beige FirstAwakening Family and Kin My family In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow had the first awakening. We stepped into a higher stage of consciousness. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says \u0026ldquo;Dad, what is that?\u0026rdquo;, And the dad says, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We call it the moon\u0026rdquo; And both feel the awe and wonder of the world. This is where it all started. We have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don\u0026rsquo;t know when we started to use language and when we first awoke to I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Using imagination we could now travel into the future and the past.\nThis is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply letting in the full beauty of the world. This is the stage with the best sex \u0026ndash; primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty ecstatic dance.\nThe deep work of healing our traumas has to start here. In the body. The body keeps the score. Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens, like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off. The body has a deep wisdom of its own. But what a miracle to find a conscious mind inside our bodies. What a delicious thing it is to look out at the world and be a part of it yet separate.\nThis stage is the satisfying itch people scratch when they watch a Zombie Apocalypse movie. A small band striving to survive in a hostile world where everyone is trying to kill them. This is the stage survivalists and preppers are living in \u0026ndash; in the end you can\u0026rsquo;t trust anyone else to keep you and yours alive.\nAnd just like in a Zombie Apocalypse series this survivalism eventually starts to pall. It is not enough to simply survive. We need something more. We crave meaning and purpose. And we start to look to others and begin to see the outlines of a bigger vision.\n"

Both were exploring all the stages of human development from the highest and lowest. Clare Graves\u0026rsquo;s health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues Don Beck and Chris Cowan. They took Grave\u0026rsquo;s original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus. I don\u0026rsquo;t cover his variations because my focus is more on the group than the individual. That was Don Beck\u0026rsquo;s focus as well. He made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid. Later on he tried the same thing with Israel and Palestine. He saw how this theory could transform the world. It is that focus that I am most interested in here.\nThis is what I love about Spiral Dynamics:\nIt is a practical tool. It is meant to be of use. Please judge it by its practical benefits. It suggests concrete actions to deal with the world.\nIt helps us understand why \u0026ldquo;those\u0026rdquo; people act as they do. Depending on what stage you are at, the world looks very different. To \u0026ldquo;those\u0026rdquo; people\u0026rsquo;s point of view they are not doing anything wrong. In fact to them it is clear that it is \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; people who are the problem! When we better understand people it is easier to open our hearts to them. And that is when real change is possible. You learn to stop judging people as hopelessly crazy and evil, and instead meet them from within their world view.\nIt teaches us to welcome all parts of ourselves. Even the parts that we resist. Especially those.\nIt sets a concrete goal for where we need to go. If everyone was at the highest stage, the world would be transformed in an instant.\nIt is circular (in a spiral way). The later stages circle right back to where we started. To where we need to go again.\nThe original idea was that we all go through developmental stages. As infants slowly mature into adults they go through many developmental stages. The same (they thought) can be said of human history. We started as animals and then have gone through and are still going through many societal developmental stages. Not every society has gone through all the stages yet. The beauty of Spiral Dynamics is that it recognizes that this transformation is not in a straight line, but a circular spiral. We keep on coming back to where we were before but from a higher vantage point. Note that no stage is \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; than any other. Each is a complete, vast world unto itself that could easily (and does!) consume many lifetimes to explore. When we go on to the next stage it does not make us a \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; person. And we don\u0026rsquo;t have to throw away all the learnings of the previous stage; we can bring those learnings with us. Going to a new stage gives us access to a new way of viewing the world. The more stages we go through the more views are available to us. Historically these transitions have been rough. We lost some important things. Our ultimate goal is to circle back to where we started.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to take you through each of these historical stages. Lets start way back at the beginning.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Let\u0026rsquo;s start. May I have your permission to dream with me? Dream way, way, way bigger than you maybe normally do? OK? Here is my question: What do you really want. I mean really. Yes, yes you can have a billion dollars \u0026ndash; boom \u0026ndash; now keep on going deeper. This is a dream after all so you can have anything. What do you want beyond just the superficial stuff? Maybe deep happiness for yourself? Yes, please hold on to that part of the dream, but try going even a little further. Maybe dream of happiness for others? Certainly you can dream of happiness for your loved ones, but how about living in a world of joy for all? Wait, you can imagine a billion dollars but not that? Stay with me here. Let\u0026rsquo;s try again. Stop and breathe. Settle down into your body. Notice where you are and everything you are feeling in this moment right now. And then ask yourself the question again, but this time from your heart. What is the biggest dream you can dream? How big can you open your heart? Notice if resistance comes up. That is very normal. Take a breath again and see what is going on. Is the resistance still there? Try to really get in touch with what this is about. Know this is our core work \u0026ndash; it is going to guide us on what needs to happen. Just about all of us are working on expanding our hearts past this resistance. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we ever are done with this work. And we all can use teachers.\nMy first great teacher was my son. It happened in an unexpected way. After graduating from college I flew to Japan to teach English. My third week in Tokyo the Japanese woman I was seeing became pregnant with my child. She was fifteen years older than me, and we had been having a fling. No love between us at all really. She told me to go, she could handle this. But I had a waking vision \u0026ndash; I never have waking visions \u0026ndash; of a 18 year old stranger knocking on my door saying, \u0026ldquo;Dad?\u0026rdquo;. I had no idea of \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; needed to happen, but I was so very, very clear \u0026ldquo;not that\u0026rdquo;. And that turned out to be enough. We got married with the plan to divorce in a year just to make my son “legitimate” in Japanese law. But I fell in love with my son and could not leave. For the next couple of years I poured as much love into my time with my son as I could. Never taking for granted that this was going to last. And I was astonished to learn that the more love I poured in the more I had to give. The love kept on getting bigger and bigger. Fortunately I persuaded his mom four years later on to move to the U.S. and I got to stay with him. That relationship with his mom was fraught and incredibly painful, but that pain seems so small compared to the incredible gift of my son. And I learned so much. It was my first step into that bigger place of love.\nWhen I try to really open up to this huge dream of a world of joy for all, there is something inside me that resists. As if I am not worthy of something as grand as that. But for my children? I love my children with all my heart and want the world for them. And in fact I want the world for all children. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have children, hopefully you can feel that too. So for them? yes, with all my heart I can ask for a better world. I want an amazing, vibrant world for them. It is so hard to ask for this for myself, but so simple to ask for them. So maybe it really is that simple. Just let our love for our children guide us. What kind of world works best for raising children? Focus on that. What horrible secrets are we keeping from our children? Get rid of that.\nHow do we create a vision of this bright beautiful new world? We don\u0026rsquo;t have to \u0026ndash; it has already been done by many people. My favorite version is called Mr. Roger\u0026rsquo;s Neighborhood. Both a documentary and a movie about Mr. Roger\u0026rsquo;s neighborhood came out recently. I strongly recommend watching both. They complement each other:\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Won\u0026rsquo;t You Be My Neighbor? This is the essay that inspired the movie, I highly recommend it too. It is very powerful:\nCan you say hero? Fred Roger told every child they are beautiful and perfect just the way they are. Great start! I want the whole world to be like that. I want a world where every child grows up without trauma, safe and secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved and cherished. I want every child to have many adults that love them unconditionally and who they can turn to when they are confused or hurting. Every child encouraged to flourish and taught to recognize the majesty and beauty of this world. And just like in his show I want them to know that people can work through their differences in healthy, loving, productive ways. How can we settle for anything less than a world that is healthy for our children? I want a world that works in all ways for children. It is not enough to just stabilize our climate \u0026ndash; that is the bare minimum. I want a world where our children thrive. To grow up in a culture of kindness and respect, not in a climate of fear and hurt.\nDoes this sound too naive and simple? Consider the alternative. Particularly in the U.S. Think of the shooting of little children at Sandy Hook or Uvalde elementary. If you are willing and able, please let yourself feel at least a little of the horror of all those dead little bodies with bullet holes bleeding on the ground. And it is completely OK if that is way too much to let it in even just a little \u0026ndash; that is exactly my point. We have had countless mass shootings of children. And nothing has changed. So many children dead, so many parents grieving. And somehow we are OK with this. Children mercilessly separated from their parents at the border, and then somehow the government \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the parents. Those orphaned children will be scarred for life. And we are somehow OK with that too. Black moms having to explain to their sons how dangerous a world it is for them. As if those boys are not all of our sons. And with global climate change there is a very realistic possibility that billions of future children may die. Seriously. What species cares so little for its offspring? This is so not OK. Something has to change.\nIt is all the same work Wait you might be thinking. You keep on switching back between things like school shootings and climate change. Aren\u0026rsquo;t those very different things?\nWhether you are working on climate change, racism, patriarchy, or gun control in the end we are all doing the same work \u0026ndash; widening the circle of compassion to include all of us. Seriously, no kidding, all of us. And that includes the future generations that currently have no say in how we are treating the planet. They count too.\nWe need to widen our circle of compassion big enough to love everyone unconditionally. Learn to love people exactly as they are, and spend the time to truly understand them. This will require hard work, of course. Whole worlds will have to be opened up and immense struggle, effort and yes many tears will be necessary just to even get started. But in the end this is where we will have to end up. How can it be any other way? Unless and until we discover that we are all one and we solemnly commit to love, revere, and care for each other as we would for our very own the world does not heal.\nHelp me here. Does this not make sense? That all this work is ultimately the same? Do you need further explanation on why teaching people to care about the Black man dying under the knee of a callous police officer is the exact same work as teaching them to care for future generations? I\u0026rsquo;m honestly asking. It seems so obvious to me but maybe not to you? Both stem from too tight a circle of compassion. It is all too human to treat others as not-quite-humans. The work to get people to bring more people and (species) into their heart is the same no matter which group you are trying to get them to expand to. First understand them and meet them where they are. Then help them out of the pain that is blocking their hearts, and then together open up to a crazy big dream of love.\nThe gift of righteous anger This work is not something we can pretend is not our own. We can not continue to pretend this is something the next generation will take care of.\nPlease watch this video:\nGreta Thunberg is talking directly to me here. To my failures. To all the adults who have so badly failed her. It is not her job to save the world, but ours. How dare we push this on to future generations. How dare we not own up to our own very great failures and commit to doing better. She is speaking from a place of sacred, righteous anger. Although she shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to be, she is showing up as my teacher. Teaching me how to be more effective in the world. I was so scared of my own anger that I sat on it and hid it all my life. No longer. This kind of anger is so necessary. It brings a precious gift \u0026ndash; the fire and passion to meet our problems head on instead of running away.\n"

Finding the right story transforms and strengthens. Makes things clearer. Gives courage and a direction. We all need to find our own story. The reason why we came to earth. But we also need to find our shared story. What is it that we are meant to do together?\nSpiral Dynamics can provide this shared story. Although it was originally conceived as a scientific theory I think it is better seen as an explaining story. A story that helps us make sense of things.\nIn the first sub-section I am going to introduce the theory and then tell the story. In the next sub-sections I spiral through the stages going a little deeper\n"

	"content": " I don\u0026rsquo;t oppose all wars. …What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. Barack Obama’s first anti-war speech\nSometimes we have to fight back. As I write this bombs are still falling on Ukraine. A mother and her child are killed trying to get into a shelter. Beloved pets left to wander the rubble. This has been going on for far, far too long. So many war crimes committed by Russia. Millions of people have fled the country, and the people still there have to deal with senseless death falling from the sky. We cheer as we watch the Ukrainians bravely fight back against what at first seemed hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo. Unbelievable numbers of people died in the resistance but it was sadly necessary. Unfortunately the people we were fighting, the Germans, the Japanese, believed that they too were doing the hard but necessary thing. They also were dying for something they believed in. When it gets this bad we have no choice but to fight. But our goal is to create a world where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get that bad. How do we do that? Again, we need systems thinking. We need to go deep enough to really get to the root of the problem. And as always that leads us right back to ourselves.\nThis war mentality is not just something that lives out there disconnected from everything else. We also have wars in our own minds. Of course we do! This is where war springs from \u0026ndash; where else would it come from? And just like those determined Germans thinking they were doing the hard but necessary work of fixing the world, we sometimes declare war on ourselves thinking it is the only way. I know because I did it to myself back when I declared war on myself in high school over the acne cysts. So many of us attack and belittle ourselves. We tell ourselves stories about how unattractive we are, or stupid, or lazy or whatever. And it really hurts. This pain is real and it cripples us. We can\u0026rsquo;t start to heal until we stop this violence within.\nAnd violence has no place with our children. None whatsoever. And yet we stand by and watch children get hit or screamed at. Stand by and watch as if those kids have no rights of their own. As if they are simply their parent\u0026rsquo;s property to do with as they please. And how did those parents end up like that? From their own parents. It is a long, sad cycle of pain. Putin\u0026rsquo;s childhood was quite harsh. He grew up in a traumatizing environment where he was abandoned and bullied. The psychologists, Alice Miller writes:\n\u0026ldquo;Children who are given love, respect, understanding, kindness, and warmth will naturally develop different characteristics from those who experience neglect, contempt, violence or abuse, and never have anyone they can turn to for kindness and affection. Such absence of trust and love is a common denominator in the formative years of all the dictators I have studied.\u0026rdquo;\nShe goes on to talk about how harsh Hitler and Stalin\u0026rsquo;s childhoods were and how that inevitably lead to their acting out later. We seem to have a huge blindspot here. Again the revolutionary vanguard has to have teachers leading the way. I am quite serious about that. We are not going to get to the world we want without vastly better child raising.\nAt my daughter’s alternative high school every student has a weekly visit with a therapist. It is built into their schedule. Since everyone does it, it has no stigma. We had been trying to get her to a therapist for years, but now it just happened naturally. And it helps! Why don’t we have at the very, very least this for every child. It costs too much? How expensive is it to have a school shooter, or send someone to prison? What is the cost of a teen committing suicide?\nWhat a good therapist does is help us create a safe place within us. A place where it is OK to know our truth without immediately taking that truth and using as a stick to beat ourselves with. Make no mistake — we all have dark truths within us. Things that we don’t really want to know about ourself. We point at extreme examples like Putin and Hitler and try to “other” them. As if we don’t have those dark seeds within us as well. The very first step is to make peace with that darkness. To not other it and to not lash out at in anger and fear. And this might be way, way too hard to do on our own, so maybe we find a therapist (or personal growth class) to help. And once we secure this first beach of safety we are ready to go on. We are ready to step into Truth.\n"

	"content": "There sometimes is tremendous temptation to help people along by getting a little tough with them for their own good. Maybe hold them accountable for what they said they would do but didn\u0026rsquo;t. Maybe point them in the direction they need to go and push them a little. Some personal growth workshops take this approach and for a brief time people will have remarkable results. But the results don\u0026rsquo;t last. This is not the path to healing. Not really. And sometimes when we push too hard we hurt people. I had a good friend badly wounded by the Landmark Forum. They pushed her so hard she had a nervous breakdown.\nPeople are ready to do their work when they are ready for it. It does not help to push them along, in fact it often make things worse. Certainly it is important to help guide people, but we must always respect and honor their internal knowing. They know what is best for themselves at any given moment. They are the ones doing the healing, not us. We merely are helping them find their way. We must meet people where they are, and invite (not push) them forward toward what they truly want for their lives. It has to come from within. Unfortunately this is not yet universally recognized in the world of healers. There are groups that still think that at times you need to really challenge people. I really understand that temptation because sometimes I feel it strongly myself. But it is ultimately a false path. True change has to come from within. We can not force it.\nAnd there has to be trust. All parts of us need to know that it is safe. A Hakomi practitioner works skillfully with the many parts of us. The initial sessions quite often are about letting the client realize how truly safe they are. And that lets the process go to the very deep places where quite often we find the need to have a conversation between our hurt child and our adult. The therapist facilitates this conversation \u0026ndash; it is oddly kind of like couples therapy. Both parts need to hear from the other and be reassured that they are loved. Both need to learn how to better listen to the other. And there are more parts in us than just the child and the adult. Coaxing them out into the open is exquisite, delicate work and even the slightest hint of forcing can shut the whole process down.\nPurple reminds us how much we need each other. For the longest time I would describe this black hole inside me that threatened to try and suck in everything if I let it. Until one time I was doing a naked HAI share talking about my black hole and suddenly I realized this “black hole” was just a hurt, needy little boy that wanted to be held and comforted. I had this whole story about how he was asking for way too much, but all he desperately wanted was to be loved. That is not too much. It is ok to need love and affection. It is truly ok for that little boy to be needy. My job is to just hold and love him. There seems to be two different kinds of self love. One is loving yourself when you are by yourself. Introverts know how to do this, but it is a skill everyone should and can learn. The other is loving yourself when you are with others. Extraverts know how to do this but again everyone should learn. We need to love ourselves both when we are alone and when we are with others.\nIt is in group that we can see ourself reflected back by all those mirrors of others. We see ourself in others, we see how others see us. And others can see clearly where we are stuck even if we can’t. A wise group knows not to push here, but when we are finally ready to step into that fuller truth the group is there to support us and cheer us on. We find our deeper truths when we are in group. Let’s go back to Truth but as a Purple group now.\n"

	"content": "\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t quite explain why, but I know what he is saying is not true\u0026rdquo;. We were sitting in a grassy courtyard surrounded by the dark-grey University of Chicago walls. Grey, grey minds always peering down at you was how a friend described the walls, but it was sunny and we were sitting on a park bench looking at the surprisingly pretty, purple-grey pigeons hop around on the grass. We had just gotten out of class, and for some reason this brilliant young woman was taking me into her confidence. The class was a small freshman seminar based on the Great books. At the moment we were studying Immanuel Kant, a genius philosopher, who had written a book arguing very persuasively that morality could be explained entirely on the basis of rational, logical rules. He was saying, in other words, that any moral decision can be decided if you just think rationally enough about it. I had found myself persuaded, but this young woman was not, and that is what we were talking about.\nShe thought for a moment, searching for a way to explain herself. I sympathized with her - it was hard to argue against a genius. \u0026ldquo;I know he\u0026rsquo;s wrong because I tried to commit suicide, but I\u0026rsquo;m still alive. I chose to stay alive because I realized that life is good.\u0026rdquo; I looked at her not knowing what to say. This was not the typical University of Chicago conversation. This school, more than most, treasured the clear calmness of pure rationality. It was why a lot of us had chosen the school. What she was saying was emotional and non-rational, and yet it felt incredibly powerful and vibrant. It had the smell of truth. But I also recognized the truth in what Immanuel Kant was saying \u0026ndash; along with all the other philosophers we were reading. How could such conflicting views both seem so right? Something was wrong here, but what? It was the start of my crisis of faith.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m in a lot of pain, should I commit suicide? \u0026ndash; what a deeply moral question, and yet how absurd to think that the answer should come just by thinking strictly rationally about it. What this woman was trying to tell me, I think, was not that life is always good and wonderful, but that something was telling her to keep on going. Some non-rational part of her recognized that simply being alive is good. And that voice kept her alive whereas if she had just listened to her rational, despairing mind she probably would be dead.\nShe was rejecting the notion that morality was nothing more than another branch of mathematics. And yet that is exactly how University of Chicago students typically approached a problem. Our approach was to think about any question as purely rationally as possible. We believed that if we only peered deeply enough with our rational minds then Truth would be revealed.\nPeople tend to think of religion as worship of God, but I think it is more accurate to say it is based on faith. And in a real sense we were following an essentially religious path \u0026ndash; we were basing our lives on a discipline of deeply held faith. We had deep, deep faith in the power of Reason. But my faith was shaken. Reason alone was not getting me answers to important questions. Maybe I was on the wrong path?\nMy dorm at University of Chicago. The conversation was in front of this building on a picnic bench. "

	"content": "I have a practical problem here. I want to chart a path to Turquoise, but as far as I can tell that has never been done. This is something new. I do know the healing/wisdom paths that I found. They worked for me. And I saw them work for others. So let\u0026rsquo;s start there.\nIn the sections to come I am going to tell my healing and growth stories. Here I introduce the schools where I did much of this work. Each of these schools has an experiential (Beige) side that has people heal and grow simply by experiencing what the school has to offer. But each school also has a group (Purple) side where you join the community and offer service to the world.\nHakomi Hakomi is a beautiful form of body centered, talk therapy. The question asked over and over again in different ways is \u0026ldquo;Where are you feeling this in your body?\u0026rdquo;. And then you are invited to deepen into that. It is the only form of talk therapy that has ever worked for me. A typical Hakomi sessions takes the client way, way deep into themselves. They enter a liminal state of here and now. Here in their body, deep into all their hidden parts. To get there the client has to know how safe and welcomed all parts of them are. How even those pesky defenses they have are welcomed and celebrated. And it is at these deeper layers that we find where we formed our core beliefs, our core stories, and now we have the choice to choose a new story.\nAfter you have done some healing work, some people feel called to service. To learn how to provide this amazing healing service to others. The Hakomi Institute offers many classes and they are open to everyone. They range from one day workshops to a two year program. I did the two year program. Each year we had ten three day weekends. Those weekends felt like a personal growth weekend to me. They taught us the Hakomi principles, and we kept on coming back to them throughout. But these principles turn out to not just be good for therapy. They are also a sound foundation to build a life on. They also seem to be the principles the other personal growth schools in my lifer were operating from, even if the other schools weren’t explicitly aware of them.\nMedicine work The Medicine school I attended was strongly influenced by Hakomi. It is just so obvious when working with people that you first need to get them more connected to their bodies. Get them to slow down enough that they can actually notice moment to moment what is going on for them. We were taught to use the Hakomi principles when working with our clients.\nThe school uses two medicines, MDMA and mushrooms. After doing some initial talk sessions to establish trust and to work on the client\u0026rsquo;s sacred intent we start with an MDMA journey. This medicine works in the realm of relationship and body. Relationship to yourself and others. And it is where we can start working on the traumas. There is a whole fascinating physiological explanation of why MDMA is so effective for working with trauma but I won\u0026rsquo;t go into that right here. Just know that it works, and there is really good science backing that claim. Then after the guide feels that the client\u0026rsquo;s traumas are now somewhat manageable (they never really go the way, we just learn to assimilate them better), then it might be time to explore the realm of spirit and the \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; world that we visit when we ingest psilocybin. We don\u0026rsquo;t jump straight here because if the client has unprocessed trauma a psychedelic journey can be really brutal. This is how many people got so hurt in the 60\u0026rsquo;s and 70\u0026rsquo;s. But held in the right way, this sacred journey into self can be life changing. For many, the initial entry into this other world can be rough, but quite often they land in a place of beauty beyond imagining.\nAfter receiving such profound healing and awakening, some people feel called to be of service and lead journeys of their own. And learning to guide deepens them into their own healing. For many years there was a thriving medicine therapy teaching program in the Bay Area. Unfortunately that fell apart, but others will rise. This work is too important for it not to.\nHuman Awareness Institute (HAI) It is hard to explain a HAI workshop to someone who has never done one. You have to experience one before you can fully understand. HAI holds weekend retreats where people are welcomed to a \u0026ldquo;room of love\u0026rdquo;. The workshops each have a different theme but in addition to that they always work on healing the shame we carry about our bodies and our sexuality. They don\u0026rsquo;t do too much explicit teaching (except for a bit on sexuality), but the exercises are designed to help people be more mindful of what is going on for them moment to moment, and to give them opportunities for profound healing.\nHAI doesn\u0026rsquo;t just tell you to open to love it has you jump straight in and do it. Before HAI I believed, in a theoretical way, that we all are faces of God/Universe. At HAI it no longer was theoretical \u0026ndash; I was loving the person right there in front of me. For real, with all my heart. And then stepping to the right and loving this one, and now this one. Felt it in my heart and body. They call the Sunday of the workshop \u0026ldquo;Miracle Sunday\u0026rdquo; because of the amazing transformations. Again it is something you have to actually experience to understand.\nAfter you have done the levels, if you want to go deeper there is the call to service. To join as volunteer for the workshops. You have to take several training classes, and you have to pass an active listening assessment before you can even be a provisional team member. Not everyone passes. Then you have to assist two or three workshops and get a thumbs up from the other assistants and facilitators. When you assist the levels it gives you a chance to really deepen into the practices. People who are ready to go even deeper are called interns and they publicly commit to live by a set of principles. These principles are remarkably similar to the Hakomi principles.\nForest Bathing This school of healing was inspired by the Japanese practice of forest \u0026ldquo;bathing\u0026rdquo;. ANFT certified trainers take people out on very gentle nature walks. Participants are invited to slow down and connect their body with the more than human world. They step into a liminal state of here and now, in relationship to all the beings surrounding them. It provides safe support and structure to connect with the natural world. After every invitation, people come back to a circle and are invited to do a short, heart based share of what they just experienced. Hearing from others helps people to go even deeper into the experience\nAfter rediscovering their intimate, vital relationship with nature, some people feel called to service. To learn how to guide others to find themselves in the natural world. ANFT offers a six month certification class followed by a four day immersion retreat to train people to lead forest therapy walks. Although ANFT doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an explicit set of principles, they might as well adopt Hakomi\u0026rsquo;s. They would fit perfectly.\nBuddhism In college, I desperately dived into Zen meditation to escape my anxiety. It worked beautifully. Zen opened me to a spirituality free from religious dogma. But most practitioners did not seem fully happy. Zen had only half the answers I was looking for. And I went on to other things. But it had a profound impact on me. Later I started to read Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach and I discovered that they follow a practice (called RAIN or RAINING) that is almost exactly the same as Hakomi! And yet again the principles are the same.\nSo what are these principles I keep on talking about?\n"

	"content": "Huge acne cysts sprang up on my face at the end of my sophomore year in high school. They swelled so big that my skin was pulled painfully tight and made it hard to smile. They were almost as big as ping pong balls \u0026ndash; I am not exaggerating. And when finally, finally I forced them to pop they left very big, deep, pitted scars. And they kept on coming. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the ugliest just like that. And in my bewildered pain I made a choice to protect myself. My ugliness made me vulnerable so I decided to do a sort of amputation. To cut off the part of me that cared about how I looked. So I stared into the mirror and told myself over and over \u0026ldquo;You are ugly\u0026rdquo;. I was trying to toughen myself. This got all the way in because it was actually done with loving intent \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to be able to hurt me. And I was so sure it needed to be done. That it was the only way to protect myself. But it actually destroyed me. I\u0026rsquo;m not alone. We attack and belittle ourselves. We tell ourselves stories about how unattractive we are, or stupid, or lazy or whatever. And it really hurts. This pain is real and it cripples us. We can\u0026rsquo;t start to heal until we stop this violence within.\nAfter this mirrors terrified me. And for good reason! Looking in them hurt. All I saw in that mirror was someone so ugly no one could possibly love. And yet sometimes I turn and face my fears. It was hard but I was tired of the pain, tired of running away. So I found myself at that rustic Wall workshop staring at myself in a big bathroom mirror. It was all I could do to just stand there and look. I\u0026rsquo;d heard about an exercise where you look at a mirror and say to yourself, \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo;. But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t anywhere ready for that, it was all I could do to just stand there. Simply staring at myself felt like a victory of sorts. It was an excellent start. I was starting to do my work. On the final day of the workshop we were asked to walk into the woods with our simple lunch and reflect alone on some questions. I sat on a log next to a river eating slowly. I just love being in nature. It had been raining gently on and off all day, and I started to notice the dewdrops on all the bare branches around me. All these many little buds of water were reflecting light. I looked into one and saw my miniature reflection – and suddenly realized I was literally surrounded by mirrors. Everywhere I looked I saw mirrors, and I felt wonderfully connected to all of these reflections. It was a golden, even a spiritual moment for me. On my slow, steady but joyful walk back to the main cabin I stopped to see myself in all the puddles and beads of water along the way. And it changed me. In some ways it wasn’t much of change – I was still the same person as ever, but in some ways it was profound. An instructor who saw me several years later after I had gone through all of this work said, “You look more comfortable in your skin”. I love that description; I think it describes it nicely.\nPeople are ready to do their work when they are ready for it. It does not help to push them along, in fact it often make things worse. Certainly it is important to help guide people, but we must always respect and honor their internal knowing. They know what is best for themselves at any given moment. They are the ones doing the healing, not us. We merely are helping them find their way. We must meet people where they are, and invite (not push) them forward toward what they truly want for their lives. It has to come from within. Unfortunately this is not yet universally recognized in the world of healers. There are groups that still think that at times you need to really challenge people. I understand that temptation because sometimes I feel it strongly myself. But it is ultimately a false path. True change has to come from within. We can not force it.\nAnd there has to be trust. All parts of us need to know that it is safe. A Hakomi practitioner works skillfully with the many parts of us. The initial sessions quite often are about letting the client realize how truly safe they are. And that lets the process go to the very deep places where quite often we find the need to have a conversation between our hurt child and our adult. The therapist facilitates this conversation \u0026ndash; it is oddly kind of like couples therapy. Both parts need to hear from the other and be reassured that they are loved. Both need to learn how to better listen to the other. And there are more parts in us than just the child and the adult. Coaxing them out into the open is exquisite, delicate work and even the slightest hint of forcing can shut the whole process down.\nHAI works the same way. Hai welcomes and loves us just as we are. HAI workshops are a safe place for people to really show up fully. HAI facilitators model loving, compassionate connection from the very beginning of a workshop. It turns out that quite often the biggest work people have to do is to stop the violence within. Stop the hurtful commentary that many of us having running all the time without even really realizing it. We have so many war zones within us, no wonder the world has so many war zones without. When we call a cease fire within we create the space to find out what is going on with ourselves. Without this ceasefire we need to keep things secret from ourselves lest we use that as fresh reason to beat on ourselves yet some more. So we actually have an internal conspiracy to not let ourselves know. But we do need to know. Healing doesn\u0026rsquo;t work unless we get to the deeper Truth. So first we have to make it safe. Then, and only then, can we get to our deeper truth. That is the next step.\n"

	"content": "Before I continue let me first address some questions or concerns I suspect people might have.\nSpiral Dynamics can encourage a sense of superiority Yes this is true, unfortunately. This is maybe the biggest problem with this story. As soon as you set up a hierarchy people naturally want to be right at the top. I thought this didn\u0026rsquo;t apply to me until someone dismissed me as merely (at best) Green. I was so upset! How dare they! Then I caught myself \u0026ndash; oops. Me too. But remember no stage is better than another. All the stages have deep wisdom, and we want to welcome all they have to offer. And it is usually just a matter of privilege who is at what stage. I happened to be born into a very Green family so I grew up into it. All stages are available to everyone. We want everyone to learn all the stages — it is just an historical accident that has us at different stages. So it is silly to feel superior. But we are human and so we will find ourselves going to that place of superiority anyways. Just know that you will, catch yourself (with compassion) and then find your way back.\nSpiral Dynamics is not established science As far as I can tell Spiral Dynamics has not yet been subjected to serious, sustained scientific review. The theory is just now gaining attention, so I think getting that review is just a matter of time, but in the meantime we need to be very careful in the claims we make. That is why I am so careful to tie the major stages to well recognized historical periods. That seems like a solid foundation to build on. I have done a lot of historical research to make sure what I say is accurate and I will correct any errors people find. But more than a theory I think we need a story that explains how we got here. Spiral Dynamics does that well.\nThere are different interpretations If you listen to people talk about Spiral Dynamics you will hear important differences in interpretation. Again my approach is to focus on what history teaches us. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to be a historian, but I have an amateur\u0026rsquo;s passion for the subject. That focus leads me to, for example, a different interpretation of Red and Blue than you might hear from others. It is clear to me that Red coincides with the advent of empire, and that Blue was a reaction to that ruthless empire. Others might not have even thought about whether the Roman empire was a Red or Blue stage, but I think the difference is crucial.\nIt is too simplistic to give someone just one label This is true. Spiral Dynamics is a better explanation of groups than individuals. People are complicated and contain many layers at once. Perhaps at work someone is a dedicated scientist (Orange), but at home they find deep solace in their simple, unquestioning Catholicism (Blue). And maybe their passion is camping (Beige). How do you put that person into just one Spiral stage? I find it seems to work better to focus on group behaviors. Those seem to average out to one stage or another. So a science organization is Orange and the Catholic church is Blue.\nAnd countries contain a mix of groups, each at its own stage. For example the U.S. currently finds the Republican party succumbing to an unhealthy form of Red while the Democrats are an interesting combination of stages but predominantly Orange and Green.\nCan you skip a level? No, not the way this theory is set up. Each stage is a reaction to the one before it. So you can\u0026rsquo;t skip stages. Each stage is necessary. For example you can\u0026rsquo;t just jump straight from Red to Orange. People first need to wake up to the Truth and community of Blue. That has to happen first before they can then react against Blue to find their way to the individual liberties of Orange. Orange shares with Red the focus on the individual, but Orange is still grounded in the law and order of True Blue. The difference between a Red businessman and a Orange one is that the Orange business man still wants to make money, but feels morally constrained by the law, whereas the Red business man is primarily worried about getting caught. Do you see how both are still focused on individual concerns but the Orange stage has Blue working in it as well?\nI feel uncomfortable with the implied hierarchy We are all better at some things than others. A plumber knows way more about plumbing than me, but I know more about programming. Maybe you know more about spirit, but maybe I know more about personal growth. I might be at a \u0026ldquo;higher\u0026rdquo; stage than someone, but that does not make me superior. It just means I can see some things they don\u0026rsquo;t. Let\u0026rsquo;s try a thought experiment. Imagine me in my 40\u0026rsquo;s, struggling in my marriage, joining the Peace Corp and getting sent to work with a tribal shaman to stop a contagious disease breakout. That shaman will hopefully be wise enough to recognize they should listen to me on how to stop the spread of the disease. On the other hand I hope I would be wise enough to listen to the shaman about pretty much everything else. There was so much I needed to learn! I might be able to see some things more clearly about disease, but that in no way makes me superior to the shaman. There are so many important things to know; these spiral dynamic stages are just one of them.\nAre there more questions or concerns? Let me know and I will add them here.\nOK with that hopefully handled, let\u0026rsquo;s get started. Let\u0026rsquo;s put this theory to practical use.\n"

	"content": "How do we know what color level someone or a group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:\nAre they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)? What do they know to be True? What are they willing to die for? Let\u0026rsquo;s go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.\nBeige (FirstAwakening) At Beige focus is on the individual family (tick). You know to be true what is right in front of you. You are willing to die for your family. There are a surprisingly large number of people buying missile silos to convert them into survival shelters. That is very Beige level thinking. By the way, I don\u0026rsquo;t think they are necessarily wrong. If I had a lot of excess money, I would seriously consider doing something like that too. Family is where we start.\nThe whole point of backpacking is to get to this level. That is why people do it for extended periods of time. It takes a while to get back into this easy communion with nature. After you have gone a few days on the trail, the city mentality starts to finally fade away and we can finally just let ourselves be one with the world. It is a very beautiful mental place to get to. So if you find a backpacker on a long hike they are probably in that moment at Beige. The energy field of these people feels very clean and whole.\nThis is also the stage people collapse back to if they have a lot of unresolved trauma and/or pain. All they can manage is just to survive day to day. We all go here when we have a bad flu. Unfortunately some people spend most of their lives in so much pain that they spend much of their life at this stage. They can\u0026rsquo;t rally to care too much about others because they are hurting so badly.\nPurple (KinSpirits) At purple focus swings over to tribe and community (tock). You know to be true what the tribe knows to be true. You revere the local spirits of the land. You are willing to die to protect your tribe. Many indigenous people live their lives at this level. Many more of us wish we could.\nWe all have a longing to be part of a tribe whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Groups like a church, or a yoga community can provide this. If the bond is strong enough this community can be said to be at the Purple level. This can sometimes be disastrous (think of religious cults gone bad), but sometimes it can be amazing.\nRed (PowerGods) At Red focus spirals up and back to the individual (tick). You are still part of a tribe, but your people are the chosen people. You know that your tribe\u0026rsquo;s truth is the only truth. And your destiny is to rule the world. You are willing to die for the honor of your king.\nOlympic athletes are a healthy example of this stage. They are competing to be the world\u0026rsquo;s best. Why else would you wake up so early every morning and work so hard day after day, year after year? We all have that in us if we choose to find it.\nMany of the people opposed to Covid vaccines are Red. Why? First because they get their Truth from their tribe not science. Second because they are mostly focused just on individual freedom and don\u0026rsquo;t really understand the need to sacrifice for the greater good. I struggle with how much judgment I have about people who refused the Covid vaccine during the early part of the pandemic when so many were dying. But it is important to really get that these people really and truly do not have scientific thinking online. It just is not a source of Truth for them. We can patiently tell them the science facts over and over, but that will not sway them. And it is not because they are dumb. Not at all. Scientific thinking is a later stage and they just don\u0026rsquo;t have that expanded world view yet. Please, please understand that is not a matter of smartness \u0026ndash; it is a teachable skill they are missing. These people\u0026rsquo;s hearts are smaller than I want them. But that is just where they are at right now, yelling isn\u0026rsquo;t going to help.\nBlue (TrueBlue) At Blue focus spirals up and back to the group (tock). You are part of something so much bigger than yourself. Bigger even than just your tribe. You are willing to die for this greater Truth.\nMormons society is a good example of Blue. They have a beautiful focus on family and community. In my experience Mormon families do a surprisingly good job of raising their children to be decent, caring humans. Mitt Romney, a devout Mormon was the only Republican senator to vote for Trump\u0026rsquo;s first impeachment. It was an astonishingly brave thing to do. He explained why he had to do it in his speech to congress:\nI am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced. I am sure to hear abuse from the President and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\nThis is such a beautiful example of Blue. With all his heart he knows there is something much bigger than just himself, and he is guided from that bigger place.\nMormon society also is a good example of the problems of Blue. Like most Blue religions they firmly believe in magical stories because they are not yet at the science (Orange) stage. The Mormon church also has a horrible history of sexism and racism because the Green stage is not yet online. Those problems are very real, but please recognize that there are benefits here too. People like Mitt Romney will not normally vote the way we want, but they can be our allies when the stakes are highest. Like when democracy itself is at stake.\nAnother example of Blue is Alcohol Anonymous\u0026rsquo;s Twelve Steps. The alcoholic recognizes that they are helpless before their addiction and need to surrender to a higher power. They recognize that there is a vast love and strength that is waiting for them if they can finally surrender and just let it in. This is not a comfortable path \u0026ndash; quite the opposite, but the strength to bear it comes from something greater than themselves.\nOrange At Orange we spiral up and back to the individual (tick). The Truth can only be found within, and that Truth is rational. We are all individuals pursuing happiness. We need the freedom to do that. Give me liberty or give me death!\nThis is the stage where science/math comes fully online. A truly different way of looking at the world. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t appear to have learned this discipline. They pick and choose which facts are convenient to believe. Science is founded on rational thinking, but notice how much Blue faith is needed too. I personally don\u0026rsquo;t have the mathematical chops to understand Quantum Dynamics, but I trust (in a Blue way) that it is the closest we can get to the Truth right now. Each discovery takes us one step closer to Truth. Science demands that we stand accountable to the reality of the world. We can never get to absolute Truth itself but we can continue to refine our theories, always trying to get closer. When Einstein predicted that gravity would bend light, scientists measured it and saw it was true. And several hundred years of adherence to Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws were thrown out just like that and replaced by Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory. The ability to look at the facts, recognize the existing theory is wrong, and switch to a better one is incredibly powerful. It has changed the world.\nYou can tell someone is at Orange when they are able to have a fully rational discussion, and you can actually change their mind. They will listen to facts and reason and recognize (at least sometimes) when they are wrong. But Orange just can\u0026rsquo;t get, for example, that systemic racism is an all too real thing. A key tell is if they complain about \u0026ldquo;wokeness\u0026rdquo; or insist on \u0026ldquo;both-siding\u0026rdquo; the issue. They just can not see it.\nGreen At Green we spiral up and back to the group (tock). We know that science is True, but we also know that a lot of our so called rationality is just a self serving illusion. We recognize how much culture dictates what we think is \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo;. We start to break out of the colonizing mindset and look to create a world where all are treated with respect and dignity. We would die for our brothers and sister.\nThere are many less people at Green than you might think. At least in the way I have defined it. Green is a reaction to Orange. Even though Green has many (needed!) criticisms of science it does not throw out science. It recognizes that there are many other voices that need to be heard from, but science still has a place at the table. And just because you vote a certain way does not make you Green. If you don\u0026rsquo;t fully believe in science and you are group focused, you are most likely at Blue. For example the QAnon conspiracy snared many people in yoga and alternative health communities. These people presumably vote liberally, but they also do not fully have Orange critical reasoning yet. I would call that Blue.\nRecently the sorting has gotten a little easier. If you are “woke” you are at least Green. And by “woke” I mean that things like critical race theory and structural racism make intellectual sense to you.\nGreen seems to not be able to see the other stages. People at Green think that everyone sees the world exactly as they do, and if someone does something wrong they should know better. To get them to understand our vast differences they would have to do some deep personal exploration. And if they do that, that brings them to Yellow\nYellow At Yellow we spiral up and back to the individual (tick) again. We find the Truth within, but this time it is different. At this level we start to find all the levels inside ourselves. We are back to pursuing happiness like we did at Orange, but this time we have Green to make that pursuit less selfish and destructive. At this stage we recognize that we all have to find our own Truth. Group work is immensely helpful with growth work, but in the end you will need to find your Soul all on your own. We find why we came to planet earth. We would die for our life\u0026rsquo;s purpose.\nPlease note Soul work is distinct from Spirit work. People can have profound spiritual experiences at any of the stages. You can have someone who is very advanced spiritually who is still at Red. That happens all the time in fact. You can also have someone at Yellow who is not very advanced in Spirit work at all. Because they are at Yellow they will at least recognize something is there, but they have much more to discover. That also is very common.\nAnd just because someone has done a lot of self exploration does not necessarily put them at Yellow. They need to have Green online first. Green opens up the possibility that pure reason is not the only source of Truth. Green grounds us in what is truly important. It can happen that people at Orange are resistant to Green and when they have the crisis of their soul, they fall back to Blue. You can tell because even though they have done profound personal work they still don\u0026rsquo;t really get, for example, how women have an extra burden to carry in our society.\nThere is a simple way to tell if someone is at Yellow — ask them. When I tell the Spiral Dynamics story to someone at Yellow there seems to be a sense of recognition. They are living this. Yellow gets that we contain multitudes. That you can take the parts of religion that are profoundly good and not the other parts. They see the courage and integrity of someone like Liz Cheney (she was one of the very few house Republicans who actively turned against Trump after the capitol putsch), and take her where she is at (a mix of Blue and Orange). They do not dismiss her simply because she is not Green.\nI’ve talked to young people who have become disillusioned with the endless purity wars that Green is falling back into. They are pulling out of mass movements and are turning to their own truth. Maybe they want to start a farm, maybe they want to join a small ecovillage and live as musicians. They do journey work and fast out in vast wilderness for days and days. This is very, very good. It gives me hope. But I long for when they come back out of the wilderness.\nTurquoise At Turquoise we spiral up and back to the group (tock). We have found the strength and clarity of our Truth at Yellow. Now we open up to the Truth of others. Time to recognize that we are meant to be as one. We would die for this bigger, shared purpose.\nI am a Yellow that is longing for Turquoise. But Turquoise is by definition a group thing so I can not get their on my own. I need to find others. People who have done enough of their own work to find that they too want to open to something even bigger. Maybe you?\nYellow falls into the fallacy that you can get to the next stage all your own. Ken Wilber enumerates many stages after Yellow. And these stages are probably real. But he is just progressing further and further into Yellow. Don’t get me wrong — this is worthy work. But it is not a fundamental stage difference. Yellow’s blindspot is to not recognize that we are group animals. We can only progress as far as the group we are in. It is just how it works. And we collectively are not quite there yet. But it feels close.\nMy life’s purpose is to help create Turquoise. We will know Turquoise when we create it together. We will be individually strong and yet strong as a group as well. We will takes turns as teacher and student. We will take turns as leader and follower. And together we will create a culture that guides us to a much bigger joy than we have allowed ourself up to now. That is the crazy big dream I keep on talking about. You will know you are at Turquoise when you share that crazy big dream with me.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Purple KinSpirits Tribe The sacred ground Something amazing happened about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across all of the planet. And whereever we spread, populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.\nSpirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent enough to hear them. We fast and pray for days. Then head off alone into the wilderness to do our sacred initiation rite and face our internal demons. Then we return to the wild celebration of the tribe. You are back! We are so glad you are back! We are one. Tell us of your visions so that we may all learn from the spirits. You are home. You are loved. So deeply loved.\nPurple throws the best parties. It was a big part of the draw of the hippies in the 60\u0026rsquo;s. From all accounts Woodstock was very Purple. We tend to idolize this stage, but movies like Dances With Wolves do catch an important historical point. Colonists \u0026ldquo;kidnapped\u0026rdquo; by Native Americans never wanted to return when given the opportunity. The Native Americans living mostly at Purple were living a much richer, more satisfying life.\nThis is the stage when art and religion really took off. We started to awaken to a higher purpose than just the day to day cycle of survival. We turned to each other and found we share an even bigger mystery than individual consciousness \u0026ndash; shared consciousness. We are tribal animals. The cruelest punishment we can devise is to hold someone separate and solitary. We have a physical need to be connected. And as tribe we are strong. As a tribe, life is very, very good.\nAnd yet we know the story does not end here. Why on earth would we leave this stage? At first archeologists thought that everything changed because of agriculture. But it turns out that people practiced sustainable, non-backbreaking agriculture and still lived in egalitarian societies. They also lived in large cities for thousands of years. It looks like people did not leave this stage willingly. It took horrific, massive violence. Conquerors swept through the world and forced people into submission. It is a trauma we are still working through to this day. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen all at once. There were heroic rebellions where people threw off their usurpers and lived in peace and harmony for a time. Sadly it did not last and eventually the warlords ruled the world.\n"

	"content": "In Beige we look inside ourselves for our truth. In Purple we start to let the truth of others in as well. Just about all of my major work has happened in a group process like HAI. And HAI workshops revolve around group shares. People stand up in front of the group (usually stark naked) and are lovingly encouraged to share from the most vulnerable, authentic place they can find within themselves. Quite often people are inspired to stand up after having a breakthrough during one of the exercises. Or maybe they are moved to share their most painful secret. There is something incredibly beautiful about sharing your deepest, naked Truth in front of a circle of sacred witnesses. A circle that holds all of you in love. This group support helped me to get to my deeper places. Helped me get clearer about what was really going on for me. When I stood up sometimes it was like something was speaking through me. Afterwards I would sit down and run through what I just said because it was what I most needed to hear.\nGetting to the truth of the matter can be hard and scary. We tend to resist. We conspire within ourselves to not know. And there are good reasons! This work if done incorrectly is not safe. Unless we can be compassionate and non-violent with all that we discover it actually might be a good idea to not let ourselves consciously know. But that conspiracy blocks the healing that needs to happen. This is not something we can fix ourselves. We need help. Medicine Guides start with MDMA because it calms the hyper vigilant amygdala that is protecting us. It allows traumatic memories to surface. The ones that have been too hard to deal with up to now. Trauma memories are different than normal memories in that they get \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo;. People relive their war incident or car accident as if it had happened just a moment ago. Now they get the opportunity to work through these memories with their therapist and convert them to more normal memories. Trauma never goes away, but you can shift and transform it to a healthier place. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have full on trauma, almost all of us have places of such deep shame or anguish that we can\u0026rsquo;t stand to go there. The key thing is that this work needs to be done with a therapist, and ideally group support as well. Just taking molly at a rave is not going to do it.\nEven if you don’t have full on trauma, to do the deeper healing work you must first form an unusually deep bond with your therapist (and/or group). MDMA helps with that as well. Besides calming the amygdala, MDMA also turns up oxytocin, the love hormone, to open our hearts wide enough to be fully compassionate with ourselves. It lets us view our past mistakes with more forgiveness then we maybe normally muster. And it lets us form an unusually trusting bond with our guide. We need that bond because the next part of the journey can be weird and very hard. We need a guide to help us safely get there.\nPlant (eg. mushrooms, san pedro, ayahuasca) medicine trips are all about getting to the deeper Truth of the matter. Sometimes we need to really open ourselves to the universe in a really vulnerable way before we can get to the heart of it. Find out what is really going on with us. And when we finally get there we can no longer stay in that old story that is not serving. No longer can pretend we are asleep and not aware. Plant medicine is especially good for that. The trick is to find a way to make it safe. We can really hurt ourselves if we are not careful. And that is where the therapist (and/or group) come in. They provide the container of love. They are the ones reminding you that you are loved if you wander too far away.\nOthers as Mirrors At Findhorn I did a week long workshop that taught us a very powerful way of thinking — that what you don’t like in others is what you don’t like in yourself. It works the other way too; that which you love in others is that which you love in yourself. So basically people are another kind of mirror to look into. Some people resist this teaching, but I encourage you to stay curious. There is a deep truth to be found here. It may not always be true, but it is a very useful starting point when you notice you have a strong resistance towards someone. On the final day of the Findhorn workshop we went out into a field, formed circles, and shared our deepest resistances to everyone in the workshop. We shared things normally you would never share. It was really hard! Telling someone you had gotten close to, what you really, truly didn’t like about them is so hard. We had to frame it as “I really don’t like X about you which reveals that I don’t like X about myself”. One man confessed to me that he found me particularly ugly — he couldn’t get past all those deep, pitted acne scars on my face, and that meant he considered himself ugly. Later at dinner some people in the group checked in with me to see how I felt about that. No one reassured me that they didn’t consider me ugly. So there it finally was. How did I feel about this? I felt a mix of things of course, but there was a surprising amount of relief. Finally! Now we are getting to the truth of the matter.\nI had been getting lots and lots of rejections while dating. What was wrong with me? Why was I getting all these rejections? And it made for a self-fulfilling, downward cycle. Because I was getting rejected so much I was a nervous wreck on first dates so that all by itself could cause a rejection which made me even more of a nervous wreck the next time. And all this time I just blamed myself for not being a good enough dater. It wasn’t just that. This was a truth that I had been desperately avoiding. But all those huge acne cysts had left deep pitted scars. I really was ugly.\nOne woman I dated for a while was overweight and not conventionally pretty. I liked her though and thought we had promise, but then I asked her if our looks were roughly the same. I confess I secretly thought I was maybe a little more attractive than her, but her answer was very definite — “Oh! I’m much more attractive than you!” Really? Ouch. No way! So I ended up rejecting her without ever telling her why. Only later did I realize why I had acted that way. So yes I was in fact getting a lot of rejections but the truth of the matter was in my desperate attempt to protect myself I also was doing a lot of rejecting too. And all that rejecting of both others and myself was what really causing me problems. Time to get more mindful about that\n"

	"content": "Let me acknowledge yet again that sometimes we have very good reasons for hiding the truth from ourself or others. But the problem with that is until we find our way to our truth we can’t effectively deal with our problems. Let me use my acne cysts as an example again. My mother told me over and over that I was very attractive. But when my sister was having a fancy wedding, I got a call from both my mom and my sister to make sure that I would be OK with getting serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures were taken. This was clearly really, really important to them. Oh. So that is the truth. The makeup artist proceeded to plaster on as much makeup as you would do for a stage performer. To the makeup artist’s credit I think it did really help. I’m sure my mom thought it was important to hide the truth from me, but it didn’t really help me. I really had a serious problem and pretending that I didn’t (until it was time to take wedding pictures) wasn’t helping any. I needed plastic surgery.\nThe problem was that I had already visited two plastic surgeons who had assured me that oh yes they could do wonders. They planed down the top millimeters of my skin. It was horribly painful to recover from and very expensive. The cost was not covered by insurance. And both of those plastic surgeons were completely lying. After all that pain and money there was almost no change. I’m not sure if the surgeons were coming from ignorance or greed, but they definitely were not telling the truth. So that led me to believe that the situation was hopeless and there was nothing I could do. The thing is there really were competent plastic surgeons out there that could have helped me I just didn’t make it enough of a priority to find them. And for that I needlessly suffered.\nI notice that most people are comfortably somewhere in the middle of the bell curve on looks. So they don’t really know how hard it is to be ugly. This is a very real thing by the way. For example, researchers have repeatedly shown that good looking people get paid more and are given more promotions. And it really has a big impact on dating. Most people have a limit to how ugly a person they are willing to date. You probably do too. Be honest. For a while I thought, fine, I will just date ugly people. Ugly people unite! The problem with that was that being ugly really does a number on a person’s self esteem and that causes all sorts of problems in a relationship. And because you are so busy rejecting your own image in the mirror you also find yourself rejecting your ugly partner as well. Ultimately that strategy maybe could have worked, but there was a much better one. Find a competent plastic surgeon. And I did find one.\nAfter taking an intense personal growth course in my mid thirties I found the strength to try yet another plastic surgeon. And this one really knew what he was doing. Instead of just dealing with the surface he got under the skin and worked on the bony scar tissue that had built up. Now we finally were getting somewhere! It was a really big help but it did not fully solve the problem. It was enough of an improvement that I finally found a partner, but there was still more to be done. However I didn’t address it until much later when I did that big workshop on my fiftieth birthday and recommitted to fully loving myself. Then I called that competent plastic surgeon to get a recommendation for a surgeon in the bay area where I now live and I got a really great recommendation. It turns out that there was a technique of injecting silicon that had been outlawed in a bit of an over reaction to the problem with silicon breast injections. It had just been allowed again and this surgeon was old enough to have done the injections before they were outlawed. This injection planted a little seed in the skin that encouraged the skin around it to fill in the pitted scars. It took a lot of injections that were very quite painful but boy did it work. We finished up with several courses of laser surgery and suddenly for the first time in my life since early high school I was attractive again.\nWhen I found myself dating again in my mid fifties I can’t tell you how much a difference it made. Part of that was because I was much more confident but a lot of that confidence came from how many positive reactions I was now getting from woman. It was a self reinforcing loop but this time in a positive direction. So why did it take me so long to get this fixed? I was trying to hide from a hard truth. It was really hard to acknowledge how ugly I was. Understandable, but not really serving me. What I needed was to stop resisting the truth. Again with painful things like that we first need to accept them. Resistance is understandable but not helpful. And then have compassion. And then step into the full truth of the matter and choose our path from there. But getting to this truth is very tricky. We constantly have to be watching all the little tricks we are playing on ourselves to keep away from those hard truths. And that brings us back again to the practice of mindfulness.\n"

	"content": "How do I know what is true and what is false? This is a surprisingly deep question, and surprisingly few people ever think much about it. Or then again, perhaps it isn\u0026rsquo;t surprising. Whether we are aware of it or not we all have mental machinery humming along that helps us make the countless choices we need to make. Most of us instinctually recognize that messing with this machinery might cause a person\u0026rsquo;s life to break down. Indeed, I have seen it happen \u0026ndash; people can literally think themselves into craziness. But on the other hand not understanding how we make decisions leaves us helpless to our own machinery. Your unconscious machinery might have problems, and sometimes, like in the case of the young woman choosing to live or die this makes a great deal of difference. If we want to lead a deep, rich fulfilling life it is necessary to make sure that our underlying assumptions (our mechanism) is sound. And one of the key assumptions that we need to examine is how we sort data into knowledge - how do we decide if we believe something is true or not?\nThink about what is going on when you argue with someone. Presumably, we argue with people to get them to see our point of view, and hopefully convert them. Amazingly, it occasionally works, but why? How are they persuaded to change their mind? It turns out we all have an innate sense of logic. This is the basis for our reasoning. You can make a logical argument to me, and if I happen to be in a rational mood I might recognize the truth of your words.\nYou find this truth by turning inward and thinking about it. Some rational part of us just recognizes truth. This is a very powerful faculty – it is how we conquered the planet. Possibly the purest expression of pure reason is mathematics. That discipline is based on proofs. For convenience most of us in school just skipped over the proofs and went straight to using the results, but, in principle, learning Mathematics is a process of self-discovery. Mathematicians don\u0026rsquo;t believe in the proofs because someone else told them to. Instead, they believe them because they have stepped through the proof in their own head, and gone over it and over it until they find that they recognize the truth in it. When we study math proofs we go through an accelerated, significantly cleaned up re-creation of the history of mathematics. That is, we are re-creating the same mental discovery process inside ourselves as the original mathematicians - no wonder it is so hard! But the beauty of studying math this way is that you don’t have to take someone else’s word for it – you find the truth inside yourself.\nIn the same way, philosophers like Kant try to be as rigorous as possible in their arguments. That is why philosophy books are usually so hard to read – they are meant to mimic mathematical proofs. But the beauty of this approach is that you verify the truth of what the philosopher has to say in your own head. Just like working out a mathematical proof, you work (and work) with the philosopher’s ideas constantly checking your internal sense of Truth to see if you have a match. In that essay we read of his, Kant was trying to prove that all moral decisions could be based on purely rational thought alone. His hope was that all moral decisions could be approached using the same beautiful internal machinery that we use for math proofs. There would be no need to rely on arbitrary religious authorities; the truth would be self apparent to anyone willing to think about it deeply and logically enough.\nI believed this. In some ways I still do. The beauty and elegance of this approach is deeply appealing to my rational side. We all have a powerful sense of logic that can help guide us. It is imperative that we learn to use it – too few people seem to know how to think deeply. But it is not our only source of truth. We have other faculties we can turn to in addition to pure reason. Rationalists can get confused about this. Science is partly to blame for this. It has had incredible success in explaining the world. The problem is, we have almost had too much success. The tendency is to try and explain everything through scientific, rational methods. Many people take the position that they won\u0026rsquo;t believe anything that cannot be scientifically or logically proven. I think for many this has lead to arrogance and a certain mental laziness. What we forget is that as powerful and wonderful as human reason is, it is just one source of truth. There are many questions in our life where it is inappropriate to think about just rationally. The young woman deciding on whether to commit suicide or not is a dramatic example, but there are many others.\nGenius philosopher. His books are notoriously hard to read. "

	"description": "",
	"content": " Non violence Mindfulness Mind/Body Truth Change Organicity Unity Loving Presence These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. They work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn\u0026rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking. Asking \u0026ldquo;why?\u0026rdquo; to go deeper and deeper so that we can embrace all parts of the system.\nHakomi started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added here. Truth and Change were added here (scroll down). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the magic number to me.\nTruth \u0026ldquo;Get curious about that\u0026rdquo;, is a standard Hakomi invitation. Hakomi helps clients find their way to their core truth; their core story. This truth is usually too hard or scary to get to all on our own so we need help. And that is the place where healing can happen. We have to get to the deeper truth of things before we can make a change. We have to know our story before we can change it. Trying to play it safe and stay at the surface does not really work.\nWe should always be on a quest for the deeper truth. Sometimes we need help getting there, sometimes we can get there on our own, but there is always a deeper truth remaining to be found.\nNon violence \u0026ldquo;I welcome that strong protector \u0026ndash; it has kept you safe\u0026rdquo;. Hakomi doesn\u0026rsquo;t shame people for their defenses instead it celebrates what good work that defense has done for them.\nAs I mentioned earlier, getting to our core truth is delicate sensitive work and the slightest hint of judgment can stop the process in an instant. We all originally had very good reasons for our defenses. Healing comes from within. We are ready to change our core story only when we are ready. It does not help to push \u0026ndash; it actually makes it worse.\nBeyond that we have to come to terms with the harsh inner critic that we all have. We need to renounce this violence against ourselves. Maybe the most important thing is to learn to deeply love ourselves. That all by itself can help so much.\nMindfulness \u0026ldquo;Check inside and see what is going on for you\u0026rdquo;. This is the classic invitation to mindfulness. This is the first step towards the truth. What is actually going on for me at the moment? Not what I think should be happening or what is appropriate but what is actually going on.\nFor example: \u0026ldquo;My partner is having this wonderful connection with their friend, \u0026hellip; and I\u0026rsquo;m feeling jealous. Maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be but there it is\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Wow. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why but I\u0026rsquo;m feeling sad in this moment. Huh. When I stop resisting it the sadness gets that much stronger\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Wow! I\u0026rsquo;m feeling so aware of all the people at this concert \u0026ndash; they are so interesting and amazing!\u0026rdquo;\nMind/Body \u0026ldquo;Where do you feel it in your body?\u0026rdquo; This is the classic Hakomi question. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked my partner this question so many times it now has become a joke between us, and it is on the list of questions I never get to ask her again. But healing starts when we connect back to our body. Hakomi sessions get people to notice what is happening in our bodies. Where are you feeling this sadness? Your heart? There is a pain there? It feels like a hand gripping too hard? OK, as much as you are able to please let yourself really feel that gripping hand. And then we deepen into that without knowing where it is going to lead us, just trusting that the body knows.\nOrganicity We express this trust by simply asking \u0026ldquo;I wonder what wants to happen next\u0026rdquo;. The therapist is not doing the work, we are the mid-wife who is assisting the process. We try to add safety and maybe a little comfort into the what is wanting to happen naturally. We as organisms are always striving towards health \u0026ndash; Always. We might be blocked but there is that within us that always is reaching towards health. We learn to trust that process.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;organicity\u0026rdquo; is admittedly a bit awkward, but this surrender to the process that naturally wants to happen is a new concept for most of us and it does require a new word.\nUnity \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a lot of sadness. Is there sadness here for you?\u0026rdquo; Quite often when I am working with a client, a strong, unexpected emotion might well up in me. If the feeling persists I check in with my client to see if they are in fact feeling, for example, sad. And quite often, yep, they are. We form a deep union with each other that goes way beyond simply the conscious parts of our minds. Therapists can use this to help intuit what is going on with their client to better work with them.\nAnd there is a deeper, spiritual level to Unity. I believe that everything is God (or the Universe if you prefer) and God (or the Universe) is Love. This is the core teaching of Center for Spiritual Living (CSL). And this is just another way of stating the Unity principle. We are all one. It is only illusion that we are not.\nChange “It sounds like there are two parts here. One that wants to change and one that is scared”. Sometimes it is so scary to let go of our misery and pain. At least we can know what to expect. What happens if we let go of this certainty? Will we even survive? How can we know? We can\u0026rsquo;t be absolutely certain, so we hold on tightly even though it hurts so much. Adults rarely change and if they do it is only because tremendous pain pushed them to that ultimate surrender. Like an alcoholic that has to hit rock bottom before they can rise again or perhaps die. Healing is not possible until we stop resisting change.\nBuddhists teach that change is inevitable. We will all die. Everyone we know and love will die. Many of our loved ones will die before we do. And those that are left get to grieve our death. This hurts. There is no avoiding this pain and yet we try. Try to hold on to the illusion that nothing changes if only we are careful enough. Try to hold off the pain instead of accepting it all the way in. Resisting this brings tremendous, unnecessary suffering.\nBut change is not all grim talks of death and suffering. It is also the heart of creativity. We are creative beings and if we stifle the urge to create it deadens us. The times I have felt most alive is when I am creating something. I especially find joy when I am co-creating something with others.\nLoving Presence Love is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving \u0026ldquo;bubble\u0026rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same \u0026ldquo;bubble\u0026rdquo; but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other. So people can experience what it looks like.\nWe explicitly encourage people to be loving both towards themselves and towards others. We model loving people no matter what comes up for them. No one is made wrong. Facilitators (and hopefully team) model always speaking from their heart. Simply declaring from the heart that this is the Room of Love opens it up as a possibility.\n"

	"content": "In my early thirties I was working at a very stressful job and my daily, long, and hard run was my lifeline. It kept me sane. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really time myself \u0026ndash; I just ran as hard as I could. But suddenly I was no longer able to run so hard. Heck I was even starting to have problems just walking. I was also having to pee all the time. My neck hurt. My HMO doctor, trying to save money for the corporation, quickly dismissed the problem as sitting with poor posture at my computer and sent me to a physical therapist. Which was complete nonsense. I still had excellent posture from my early Zen practice, and besides I really was in pain. Fortunately the physical therapist was competent and quickly recognized that something was very wrong and managed to get me into the then very expensive MRI lab. They put me in this very narrow tube and scanned me for a long time. The scanning technician was astonished at how happy I was when they told me they had found a tumor. I was just so happy that we finally were getting to the truth of the matter.\nThe tumor was taking over the c4 bone in my spine and if we did not take it out it was going to kill me. They were going to have to remove all the nerves coming out of the left side of the c4 plus a lot of the bone. That meant I was likely to lose a lot of functionality in my left arm. I really didn’t want to lose the ability to raise my arm. One doctor told me it was hopeless. A test book case of what happens when you remove so many nerves. Another, wiser doctor told me to not give up hope. that the body will try very hard to find a way. My brother-in-law is a doctor and researched this particular kind of tumor to see how serious it was. I found out later he told my parents the prognosis was not good so they were all very worried. My family came up for the surgery and to nurse me afterwards. Fortunately they were there right before I went into surgery and got the nurse to recognize that I was swelling up bright red \u0026ndash; I was having a severe allergic reaction to an anti-biotic they had given me. Not an auspicious beginning.\nComing out of surgery I was placed into the ICU late at night. The doctor (the wise one) had had to work many extra hours to tease out all of the tumor. It had really embedded itself. I had hoped maybe not all the nerves would need to be removed but that just was not possible. They were all gone. The good news was that the tumor was not malignant, and that I was still alive. Except for maybe my left arm the prognosis was now good. I lay in bed wondering about my arm. I remembered my mirror work and started to pour love into that poor arm. And I found I had a lot of love to give. So grateful for my arm, feeling compassion for the injury done to it. I eventually drifted towards sleep but in the bed next to me was an elderly man who was struggling. The nurse kept on coming in with a very calm, but urgent voice telling that man to breathe more. The implication was that if he didn\u0026rsquo;t breathe more he was going to die right that night. I will never forget that nurse\u0026rsquo;s voice calmly saying over and over “breather. you need to breathe”.\nThere was a lull, and then out of nowhere I felt a kind of kiss on my left shoulder blade. It felt like an angel\u0026rsquo;s kiss. A light bloomed from that side of the room until it enveloped the whole room with this amazing field of brilliant, shining love. It was incredible. I and the elderly man in the bed next to me were surrounded by deep, endless oceans of love. For that brief moment, for whatever reason, I got to feel all of that ocean all at once. My world changed. We come from love and we return to love. I know this in my body now. We are one. This is not some abstract idea that sounds good. It is grounded in my body and I know it to be true. My greatest desire is for everyone to know it. This is not just my gift but everyones. There is so much joy here. I long for everyone to find it.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s get to the really woo-woo part of the story. The light seemed to help the elderly man as well. This gift was not just for me. His breathing eased and the nurse did not have to come back and badger him to breathe more. The next day I tried to summon my courage and ask him if he had felt anything last night. I was too embarrassed to clearly ask him about the light, but he did seem to indicate that something big had happened. After the surgery I was supposed to be in incredible pain and all I had to do was press a button to get a powerful morphine tablet to roll down a tube. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need them. I felt great. The nurse was worried I was just maybe toughing it out, but I really was the best I had ever been. A good friend came in to visit me, and we both laughed and laughed when we realized that I was giving aid and comfort to him instead of the other way around.\nThe nerves really were gone. For three months I could not raise my left arm. I worked with my physical therapist to do what I could. Then, in a personal growth class while talking to my small group suddenly I was able to reach my left arm to the ceiling. The wise doctor had been right after all \u0026ndash; my body had found a way. I sent a bouquet of roses to my physical therapist to celebrate. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the angel\u0026rsquo;s kiss magically healed me. What I do know is that anything held deeply in love has the potential to heal and grow. And there is a powerful magic in that.\n"

	"content": "If you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched the stink spirit video from Spirited Away yet please consider watching it now. It is such a good metaphor for this work.\nWe all have a lifetime of accumulated junk that is keeping us from our true shining nature. Notice how much courage and fortitude is needed just to get started. It feels kind of hopeless. I\u0026rsquo;m not worth the effort! But the pain keeps driving us forward. I love how the whole community rallied to help with cleaning up the stink spirit. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a community stand up for me too. I could not get there all on my own. We can\u0026rsquo;t get there all on our own.\nBack at a time when I was in an incredible amount of pain, I signed up for an intensive set of personal growth workshops. The first weekend was designed to open us up to the work and the second, longer retreat was where we did the real work. That retreat was called \u0026ldquo;The Wall\u0026rdquo; and it was named after the \u0026ldquo;wall\u0026rdquo; of exhaustion that runners hit and then keep on going. It was described as a chasm mountain climbers might find on their path. Giving them no real choice other than to leap over the chasm. And in that moment when they are in the air new possibilities open up.\nWe met at Sea-Tac airport to take a bus to a remote camp somewhere in Washington state. We didn\u0026rsquo;t really know where we were going exactly. Just somewhere deep into the woods. We slept in bunkbeds and were woken up at 6am to the shrill whistle of our facilitator dressed as a coach and set out on our daily run. Which was timed. And the times were posted. Fairly early in the retreat the facilitator asked us to commit to our life purpose. If we didn\u0026rsquo;t already know our life purpose he suggested we take on the purpose of living a deep, rich, fulfilling life. He asked us to take a solitary walk out into nature to really think about this. When we came back the facilitator said, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who is willing to commit to their life purpose please stand.\u0026rdquo; Everyone stood but me. I looked around a little in amazement \u0026ndash; how could everyone so easily stand? It didn\u0026rsquo;t seem fair. This was way too early in the retreat. Didn\u0026rsquo;t people understand what they were committing to? This was it. If I committed to this everything else was a detail. Hard, difficult details, but honestly? details.\nI had only fairly recently returned from Japan and was still married to my Japanese wife. Unfortunately, probably because of past trauma, she was emotionally and physically abusive to both my son and me. Our family was suffering. I was stumping along on duty and would have secretly welcomed a death by cancer as an honorable way out. I wanted to get divorced, but what if she returned to Japan with our son? I talked to expensive lawyers who warned me that sexism was alive and well in the courts and that the presumption was still that the child should be with his mother so there was little I could do to prevent her from taking our child. And to be honest I also shared that same sexism that assumed that a child needs to be with his mom no matter how troubled the mom is. And my son desperately needed me. I was his safe place.\nSo no. That commitment sounded lovely for others, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have that luxury. I had a son who was counting on me. At the time my word was impeccable. If I said I would do something, I really would. And making that commitment meant I would hurt my son. And yet. Someone asked what I would want for my son to do if he happened to end up in my same position? Would I want him to make the same choice I was? No, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want this for him. And someone else asked me what are you teaching him by your example? If you don\u0026rsquo;t choose a fulfilling life how he is he going to learn to choose that for himself? He is looking to you for how life is done. And finally the instructor simply called me to the front of the room and asked everyone who thought that I deserved to lead a deep, rich fulfilling life to stand up. And everyone stood. I broke down sobbing and something cracked inside of me. I found I could say yes.\nThis was such an incredibly important commitment! How could I make sure that I really honored it? I mulled this over for a week or so after the workshop until one day at work I was transferring to a new group that happened to already have two Davids so my new boss jokingly said \u0026ldquo;You will have to change your name\u0026rdquo;. I looked at him thunderstruck and said \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right!\u0026rdquo; He quickly tried to backpedal assuring me that he was just joking but I knew he was absolutely right. It was time to change my name.\nMy birth name is David. It is a perfectly lovely name. Unfortunately my generation is over blessed with them. Back in high school there were so many Davids in my Biology class every time the teacher said \u0026ldquo;David?\u0026rdquo; something like 20% of the class turned his way. Ridiculous! Too many Davids! I stomped off to the library and looked through names. Aureolus? No. Borealis? No. Chrysostom? Maybe? \u0026hellip; no. Odysseus? Something electric went through me. Yes. Yes that. Ok good, so when? When am I going to make this huge change? Not now \u0026ndash; not while I\u0026rsquo;m in still in high school. It\u0026rsquo;s way too scary. But sometime in my life something big will happen and I will know it is time.\nAnd now finally it was that time. I changed my name to Odysseus. That was the easy part. Keeping my wife in the US turned out to be easy too. I ended up buying my way out of the problem. I used my stock options to buy our house and give it to her. I also paid for all her expenses. Moving out when my son didn\u0026rsquo;t want me to go was the hardest thing I have ever done. I still cry about it. After moving out I came over frequently to read him bed time stories and Sundays were our special day together. I was still his safe place, but it was very hard for him. It is, however, what I would want for him. I found my way to a deep, rich fulfilling life, and he got to saw me thriving and happy. I was showing him by example what I wanted for him. It was incredibly hard but necessary. And it all started with making that commitment to myself. Everything else was a detail. Incredibly hard details but details none the less.\nPeople often ask me about my name and every time I am reminded of this first, very sacred promise I made. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for the question. It gives me a chance to recommit yet once again. By the way, that whole bit about getting woken up by a coach with a whistle? Brilliant theater. At the end of the retreat the facilitator confessed that every morning he would put on his athletic gear, send us on our way and then immediately change back out. Just to help us notice the unconscious stories we so quickly fall into. Notice how we just assumed we were supposed to run as fast as we possibly could. We were getting timed! We didn\u0026rsquo;t even consider the possibility that the run could be a time of connection and playfulness until the final day. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to stay in our stories. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep on running for our lives.\nThings do come up and we all find ourselves running away in fear. But if we are committed, at some point we come back and try again. And again. So I\u0026rsquo;m asking you. If you already know your life purpose, great, please recommit to that. Otherwise would you be willing take on the purpose of leading a deep rich, fulfilling life? Are you willing to really, seriously commit to that? I warn you that committing to that means all the scary things you have been putting off will have to be handled. But the good news? They will now be details. Hard, scary details yes, but details.\n"

	"content": "Everyone has blind spots. Except me. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any. This is amusing because it is so obviously false, and yet there is a part of me that really believes it. After all I can\u0026rsquo;t see my own blind spots so obviously I don\u0026rsquo;t have any, right? In other words, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But this is true for everyone. We all can not see our own blind spots by definition! Other people can know things, can be so more advanced than us on something that we don\u0026rsquo;t recognize how much further ahead they are. So when we reach an impasse with someone, it is important to stop and hold open the possibility that maybe, just maybe this might be our blindspot not theirs. Maybe they can see something that we don\u0026rsquo;t even know we don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThere are many different kinds of blindspots, but let\u0026rsquo;s focus on where one stage sees something that another stage just misses.\nScience blindspot On January 28, 1986 millions of children sitting in their classrooms watched the launch of the Challenger shuttle. For the first time in history there was a school teacher onboard, Christa McAuliffe. The networks were televising a special classroom set up for her students watching the launch. 73 seconds after launch the shuttle blew up and her students watched her die on national TV. It was a horrible, painful death. It did not have to happen. NASA engineers the day before the launch literally begged for the launch to be cancelled. But the launch had already been postponed numerous times, and if it were postponed yet again it could not be included in Reagan\u0026rsquo;s state of the union address. So the engineers were overruled. But they knew. One of the engineers, Bob Ebeling, told his wife the night before, \u0026ldquo;It is going to blow up\u0026rdquo;\nWhat happened here? Bob Ebeling was working at the Orange stage, but the NASA administration was operating at most likely Red or at best Blue. Either way the administrators clearly did not have a science/engineering mindset. There was a stage mismatch. Sometimes one stage sees things much clearer than another stage and we ignore it at our dire peril. It is an act of moral cowardice to not call it out. Bob, spent his life regretting not finding a way to convince the administrators to cancel the launch. His problem was that he tried to talk to them in the language of science/math, but that kind of thinking was not really available to those decision maker. At that time it was pretty common for Republicans to not even believe in evolution. The Green stage has done such a good job of deconstructing rationality that we sometimes forget that in certain cases one point of view is clearly superior to another. We have to be incredibly careful here of course because it is so easy to mislead ourselves that we are correct when in fact we are not. In this case, however, we are on fairly safe ground. Spaceships are very much an Orange stage construct, and disaster awaits anyone who tries to launch one without being at least at that stage. Global warming is a similar problem. Politicians who are not at least at the Orange stage are deciding to not respond to the challenge. Disaster awaits us.\nHopefully you agree with this? Good. Let\u0026rsquo;s go on to something harder.\nClass Blindspot I grew up in Waukegan Illinois. It was a gritty, dirty factory town north of Chicago. Unions were strong there. Everyone knew how much everyone else earned because we were all in this together. Only a factory owner would want to keep wages secret. Waukegan is in a region that used to be called the Steel Belt because of all the manufacturing, but in the late 70\u0026rsquo;s that all started to decline and the area is now known as the Rust Belt. Dead factories were all around us. I would sneak into an abandoned factory with a friend and it was spooky. The calendars on the wall were marked off until one day they weren\u0026rsquo;t. Desks were just left as they were. This was already happening, but the move to fully open trade was the last nail in the coffin. And the most vigorous supporter of open trade was Bill Clinton, a Democrat. He almost didn\u0026rsquo;t get elected in 92 because of this. He benefited from Ross Perot\u0026rsquo;s independent campaign that got an astonishing 19% of the vote. No other third party candidate has gotten close to that in living memory. And if Perot had run a better campaign he probably would have done much better. Maybe even won. Perot is famous for talking about the \u0026ldquo;giant sucking sound\u0026rdquo; people would hear as union jobs were outsourced. He turned out to be exactly correct. We first set up a free trade agreement with Mexico (NAFTA) and then moved on to China. Factories were already in decline at that point, but that was the death knell. Factories shut down all over the Rust belt and most importantly the unions were thoroughly busted.\nEconomists kept on insisting that the net effect of all this \u0026ldquo;creative destruction\u0026rdquo; was increased wealth for the country. But they didn\u0026rsquo;t say increased wealth for who. Some people definitely benefitted from this, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the factory workers. And the workers noticed. Hilary Clinton lost in 2016 because formerly solid Democratic Rust Belt states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan went (narrowly) for Trump. These states were crushed by Bill Clinton\u0026rsquo;s trade policies. I suspect the insult of nominating his wife was just too much for some former Democrats there. I sympathize. We betrayed them, and the most damning thing of all is that we don\u0026rsquo;t even deign to acknowledge it. Trump noticed though. He talked a lot about NAFTA at the debates. Most Greens did not even notice his talk about NAFTA. Once elected he acted tough against China. Again most people at the Green stage had no clue why he was doing that, but the Rust Belt did. The U.S. did not have to do this. Germany and Japan did not abandon their workers. We chose to.\nWhen I say \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; I am talking about people like me who have benefitted enormously from the free trade agreements. I was always very good at school so as soon as I graduated from Waukegan East HS I went straight to a fancy college and never looked back. I was set, but all the kids not so good at school were kind of screwed. I never thought much about them. Should have gone to college, losers, seems to be my classes attitude. Chris Arnade has does some really good work on this. He was a Wall street broker who found himself wandering away from work to photograph people, until he found himself doing it full time. He took the time to really look at America, and he realized that \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; are part of the front row. We are more educated and we moved to pursue high paying jobs. We left behind the back row, the people that maybe didn\u0026rsquo;t do so well at school, and stayed where they were at because of family. Please read Divided By Meaning for a quick synopsis of his argument. It is well worth reading. We have a long history of class conflict, but we keep on forgetting this. For example we forget that Martin Luther King was assassinated right when he truly (in my opinion) started to get dangerous. He was just starting to organize a multiracial army of the poor. A campaign to bring all poor people together not just Blacks.\nAt the diversity trainings I have been to, that class solidarity MLK advocated for is almost never talked about. Why is that? It is a blindspot. People at Green are almost always well educated. Which means they not only went to college but they got a really good education, and that education changed how they view the world. They see things differently. But college is also the gateway for most of the better paying, prestigious jobs. And even if you are not making a lot of money, you are still part of the cultural elite. Green is mostly blind to all of this. Does not recognize that their class has been winning. The people at Red who voted for Trump, though, are very aware. This is not the only reason why Trump is popular, racism is of course a huge part of the reason, but still Orange and Green have a big blindspot here.\nReligion blindspot It was not just factories that were starting to collapse in the 70\u0026rsquo;s. Trust in institutions also crashed. People stopped going to church. Kids no longer went to Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. People used to bowl together in leagues, now they were bowling alone. And Green cheered. Celebrated the demise of the myth based superstition of Blue religion. Celebrated the demise of (at the time) homophobic institutions like the Boys Scouts. And of course Green has a point. And yet nothing came to replace these institutions. Blue is necessary. Without a strong healthy Blue, people suffer. Polarization rose, inequality rose, and deaths of despair rose. For the first time in a very long time the average lifespan started to go down in the U.S. And Green did not care. Most Green people are not really aware of the deaths of despair. Or if they do know anything about it they simply blame it on big pharmaceutical\u0026rsquo;s greed without really understanding the full tragedy of it. People need meaning. People need community. Red needs a way to find Blue. Religion used to supply that, but no longer. At least no longer at the Blue stage. When I first started on my spiritual awakening I noticed my favorite conversations were with evangelicals. Despite our many other differences we shared a passionate love for Spirit. Tepid, cautious, dying Blue churches could not bring themselves to make a full throated commitment to Spirit, but Red churches could. And so for a time at least, Red evangelical churches thrived.\nWhen I tell people what the world needs is a new religion, they usually recoil. To the Green mindset this is the very last thing the world needs. I think they assume that any new religion would inevitably repeat the horrible mistakes of the past. But what they are missing is the desperate need for meaning and community. People need to come back to together. We have gone way, way too far on our separate paths. There has to be a balance.\nThe other part of this blindspot is that people standing firmly in Orange only believe that pure reason is the source of Truth. That only rational science should be trusted. And of course for questions like \u0026ldquo;Is it safe to launch the space shuttle?\u0026rdquo; they are absolutely right. But science doesn\u0026rsquo;t have satisfying answers for questions like \u0026ldquo;Why am I here?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;How do I lead a deep, rich fulfilling life?\u0026rdquo;. For those questions we need to reach into ourselves for other faculties, other sources of Truth. Discovering the math/scientific mindset was huge, and we should absolutely celebrate it. It is such an important source of Truth. But it is mainly useful for the exterior questions. It is not nearly as useful for the interior questions. It still has a role to play there too, but for the interior work we have to use other parts of ourself. These other parts can work together with rationality. They do not have to be in conflict. But unfortunately many people don\u0026rsquo;t know that. They think that because spirituality is inherently non-rational that means it can not be true. So they make the huge mistake of simply dismissing spirituality. That is just as big a mistake as dismissing science. It is true that Blue stage religion is typically full of myths, but what we need is a religion that brings in the higher stages as well. The book, Integral Christianity does a good job of explaining all of this if you are curious or need more explanation.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Red PowerGods Kingdoms, Empire My king. Honor This is the stage of empire. The strong ruled over the weak. We are taught to venerate Rome, but by today\u0026rsquo;s standards it was a hopelessly evil slave empire. It was very Red. Rulers the world over declared themself as God. The Pharoahs built their pyramids and other rulers demanded that their followers commit suicide when they died. And people willingly followed them into death. This is the stage of the Alexander The Great and Genghis Khan. Alexander is remembered as a \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; man, but by today\u0026rsquo;s standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. He probably killed his father to gain power. He killed a lot of other people just for the glory of it. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and Alexander (and their legions of followers) did not consider themselves evil. They considered themselves the good guys. And you have to kind of marvel at their martial excellence.\nThere is a real darkness here. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the world. The worship of the Goddess was suppressed and women became property. Slavery took root and flourished. Wealth and power went to the very top. People were forced into a brutal form of agriculture that put them into early graves. Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. This is not how we want to live, but there is no turning back. Much as we might like to go back to Purple we have no choice. We have way too many people on this planet now to sustain a traditional Purple lifestyle. It is like when Cortes landed on the shores of Mexico determined to conquer the Aztec empire. He scouted the coasts for a bit then determined he had to head inland. So he did something very Red; he scuttled his ships. Can you imagine what it must have felt like to watch that? It made very clear to his followers that the only choices now were to advance or die. It is the same for us. If we want to get home to the world we long for we have to first accept our reality. Accept this is who we are. Accept the horror and suffering. Accept that we are all complicit.\nAnd yet. We would become as Gods! Without this stage we would not have gone from looking up in wonder at the moon, to landing on it and looking back at the pale blue marble of earth. This is the stage when writing began. Think of what we are most proud of as a species \u0026ndash; conquering disease, teasing out the secrets of the big bang, learning to fly, exquisite, beautiful works of music, art, and architecture. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next stage. We were not content to simply stay just as we were. This is the stage of personal excellence. The dedication and courage of an Olympic athlete starts here. The desire to radically change the world is very Red. The warriors who fight to keep us safe have a hot Red core to them. We need this stage just as much as any of the stages, even despite all the trauma it brought. This stage can provide the courage to keep on fighting even when all seems lost and going on would be pointless. To keep on fighting even if at times it feels like just a futile and stupid gesture. As crazy as it sounds we need that.\nBut in different regions of the world at different times people woke up and said \u0026ldquo;Enough! We need something bigger than this! Life must be more than just the strong oppressing the weak\u0026rdquo;. And something did arise. Something very beautiful.\n"

	"content": "It turns out that I could have avoided those horrible acne cysts simply by changing my diet. My hometown happened to have one of the very few dermatologists in the country who understood that. If I had gone to him right away I would have been spared most of my trauma. The problem was that I have a particular kind of allergy to milk fat. And I was consuming a lot of it — I was drinking close to a gallon of milk a day (growing teenage boy) not to mention all the pizza and ice cream. If I had given up dairy, the cysts would have stopped just like that.\nI was in victim mode. When we are in victim we give our power away to something else, and hold ourselves helpless. My parents “knew” that there was nothing doctors could do about acne so they didn’t suggest I go one. That story didn’t serve me. What I needed was an accountability mindset. This mindset constantly is asking “How did I attract this? What was my part?” Instead of staying in stuck in the trance of helplessness and victim I could have explored what I could do differently to stop the acne cysts.\nAccountability is a pretty big topic and I will return to it many times. The original mantra I was taught was “I attract 100% of everything that occurs”. In other words we create our own reality. This is a basic premise of New Thought religions like CSL. I don’t think it is literally true that we attract everything — if a meteor crashes into my living room and takes me out I don’t think I literally attracted that. And there are times when we really, truly are a victim. But that is much more rare than we think. This mantra encourages us to really investigate what is our part in what arises. To keep on looking deeper into the situation even if we “know” we are just the victim here. To notice when we have a strong emotional resistance to holding ourselves even partially accountable.\nThere is a real vulnerability needed here. To put away certainty and to stand naked, unprotected before our ignorance is scary. We usually need help on finding our way. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So the therapist honors the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then helps them see how that solution also came with a price. A price that now maybe is not worth it. As adults they now have more resources and there are better solutions available. Notice how first we have to find our deeper truth before healing can happen.\nThink of people you know in your life who are struggling. Almost always they are not letting themselves know something important. Maybe they are verging on alcoholism or other addictive behaviors. Maybe they are so consumed with fear that they don\u0026rsquo;t see how they are only focused on themselves and oblivious to the harm they are causing to others. It is so obvious to us as observers, but they are not letting themselves know it. We can try to compassionately help them find their Truth but this is something ultimately they have to find within themself. We can\u0026rsquo;t do it for them.\nNow turn to yourself. You can see it in others, but what about you? What truths are you hiding from yourself? There must be some. There always are. There is a very good reason we conspire with ourself to not know the full truth \u0026ndash; it would hurt too much. But as we practice non-violence we start to feel safer with more and more of our truth. And we start to get curious \u0026ndash; how deep and vast are we? We start to develop a habit of tracking ourselves. Catching those brief instants where we see the tail of Coyote whipping around that corner. Letting us know that, huh, there is something more going on here. Coyote is the trickster that shows up whenever we get too sure we fully know our Truth. We don\u0026rsquo;t really but we think we do and Coyote just laughs and laughs at us. To find out more we need to get patient and simply watch ourselves. Yes, Coyote go ahead and laugh, you are right of course I must be missing something. I will get quiet and still enough to see what it is. I call this mindfulness. Let\u0026rsquo;s turn to that next.\n"

	"content": "Who am I to save the world? I am just this nobody on the internet. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any particular expertise or credentials. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. I am not some exalted leader to be revered. If I can do this work anyone can.\nAt first I tried to keep myself out of this essay. But again I am not coming from some place of authority that can expect you to just listen to my lecture. The thing I have to offer is myself. To give this any chance of working I can\u0026rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too. All of me is sacred and holy. All is welcome and loved. And all by myself I am nothing. I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your joy and all of your pain. All of you is sacred and holy. All of you is welcome and loved. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us. I want to hear everyone’s story.\nBut first we start with me. Let me introduce myself.\nExplorer My driving trait seems to be curiosity. I always, always want to dig deeper into the Truth of things. Especially if it is hard. The greatest gift you can give me is to help me see a truth I have been hiding from myself. This is where I started. This drive to explore has taken me to many amazing places, most of them internal.\nMy purpose is to climb tall mountains and leap into worlds unknown to chart the course for others to follow. Let me unpack that a little. I\u0026rsquo;m attracted to things that are challenging and hard. The hard work of climbing a mountain is more than worth it for the view. And again I\u0026rsquo;m talking mostly about internal challenges. Then when you finally get to the top of the mountain you now have a choice. You can go back to your familiar world or you can jump off into the unknown to see what comes. Once I have discovered some new world inside of myself I typically feel called to leap into it to really experience it. Without knowing exactly what I might find.\nNow that I’ve done a fair amount of exploring it is time for the final phase of my purpose. I have climbed a number of mountains and leapt off of them. And truly I look at all the people who have gone so much farther than me and wonder who I am to try and talk about these mountains. But it is now time to do some charting. I have some things that are worth passing on. And in fact switching to this new role feels like yet another scary mountain to leap off of. We all have these beautiful, undiscovered worlds within us. Let me show you some.\nMy Vows I have made three sacred vows in my life. I know that sounds so weird — who in this day and age makes sacred vows?!? I didn’t intentionally set out to make these vows, and it would not have worked even if I had. They actually are the key discoveries I made while doing all that exploring.\nI will tell the full story of these discoveries later on, but first let me introduce them.\nFirst vow — Lead a deep, rich, fulfilling life When I was emerging from a very dark, hurting time in my life; a time when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even sure I wanted to continue living, I made my first sacred vow. To make sure I honored that vow I changed my name. I did it to make sure I would never forget my vow. It worked. I had known for a long time before that what the name would be because I am an explorer. \u0026ldquo;Odysseus\u0026rdquo; is the archetype of embarking on an odyssey.\nThe way I found myself out of all that suffering was to do intense personal growth workshops. Those workshops (along with meditation) were one of the very few things that worked. I tried therapy with a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop ( at HAI) and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself. I had made that commitment before, but this time I really meant it. It was a big step deeper into an ongoing spiritual awakening, and brought me into a new phase of my life. After struggling with my weight for years, now I found it surprisingly easy to lose the 25 pounds needed to get back to a healthy weight. And more importantly it was easy to maintain this new weight because I absolutely only ate what worked for my body (turns out strict Paleo works best for me). I committed to aging as gracefully as possible so I did things like getting my hormones checked and started lifting weights regularly. I finally got the facial reconstruction surgery that I had been putting off, and the list goes on.\nSecond vow — Love everyone, no kidding, no exceptions I continued to do HAI workshops and at one of them a woman stood up and vowed to love everyone unconditionally. I was floored — that was such a bold, brave thing to do! It seemed almost crazy. No one had told her to do this; she just went and did it. But then at the very next workshop I found myself standing up to make that same exact commitment.\nPeople who really know me describe me as very love based. I find that description astonishing. It is true, but it is kind of like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based! I am quite attached to breathing. But so are you! And just like we sometimes forget to stop and really let ourselves breathe, we also quite often forget to stop and let ourselves really love. To me it seems obvious that everything is Love. Everything. We come from Love and return to Love. You know this to be true. Yes really. There are maybe only fleeting moments when this was really clear to you, but then as we all do you forgot. The trick is to forget less and less. I promise you there is an immense amount of joy to be found in the remembering.\nThird vow — Save the world A few years after doing those workshops. I did guided, psychedelic Medicine work and went into even deeper joy. Most mornings I find myself in joy. Now that I am mostly out of suffering, my focus has shifted to service. I want to help people not just find their way out of suffering, but into their own joy. Oceans of love are right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. Somehow, someway I want to help people let at least some of that immense love in.\nI’m stepping into the Elder phase of life. I think this is a phase that humans are supposed to go through. it is a time when we start to reconcile with our inevitable death. A time when my own needs seem less and less important. I still, of course, have my ongoing work to do but what I want to focus on most in my remaining time is the health of the tribe. Before I die, I want to leave a world that works for my grand kids. A world that works for all of our grand kids.\nCommunity Living in Japan and married to a Japanese woman really opened my eyes to community. I experienced culture shock twice in Japan. The first time was on first arriving there. Everything was so different, and I had never been to a truly foreign country before. It was a comparatively mild shock. The second, much bigger shock happened a year later just as my Japanese was starting to get good enough to give me a glimpse of how truly different the Japanese look at the world. I woke up to how I just assumed there was only one world view. I really thought everyone looked at the world the way Americans do. That is so not true! The Japanese do not view the world as a bunch of individuals making their way, they instead see the world through a much, much more group focus. The purpose of life is not just a selfish pursuit of individual happiness. I don\u0026rsquo;t think either the American or Japanese perspective is wrong. From what I could tell there is a mix of profound benefits and costs to each. But what it did was to open my eyes to how differently people can view this world.\nI have been involved in cohousing most of my life. Cohousing\u0026rsquo;s goal is to save the world one neighborhood at at time. A bunch of people decide to live together so they as a group buy some land and hire a developer to build the houses. I’ve helped build a community from scratch, and I’ve lived in two different cohousing communities. I\u0026rsquo;m currently helping to develop a third. Living in community just feels better. But most people don\u0026rsquo;t know this. Americans in particular have forgotten how to get along with other people. We use our wealth to isolate ourselves. That isolation protects us from the inevitable conflict that arises when people live in more intimate connection. But then we end up so lonely. It is not worth it. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to live so isolated. But it takes work. I noticed when people (including myself) move into cohousing there are a whole set of skills to learn. A deeper connection to community is something we all are longing for but have mostly forgotten how to do.\nPersonal Growth Mindset I have a personal growth mindset. What do I mean by that? I believe that living is something that we can get better at. There is a real savor to getting more skillful with all the things that come. We contain vast multitudes. How we chose to be moment to moment is governed more than we realize by personal preference. There are areas within us that we feel more comfortable hanging out in. But it is possible to go to the other places even if we mostly chose not to. And it is perfectly OK to not venture into those other areas. But it is important to know that is a choice we are making.\nI have experienced immense, astonishing change. When it happened, everything felt different and yet in some important ways nothing had changed at all. I was still me but now living in that bigger place of possibility. And just to be very clear my imperfections did not get wholly washed away in each transformation. What I call my \u0026ldquo;bullshit\u0026rdquo; is still very much here. It just weighs on me less and less, and I get increasingly skillful in navigating through it.\nSpirituality My passion for following the Truth led me early on to fall in love with science. What I love best about it is its hard discipline. It demands so much. You are called on to abandon even your most cherished theories and models if new, contradictory evidence comes to light. This ability to admit you are wrong is so critical to getting to Truth.\nI started out as an atheist, because of course I did. I was a scientific rationalist. Religion seemed mostly like superstitious nonsense. And yet there were these strong hints that maybe just maybe I was missing something. I tell my waking up story here, but the key point is that when I got really honest with myself, I had to admit that I am deeply spiritual. We all are, but most of us tend to forget it. We have brief moments, maybe in nature, maybe at a birth or death, where we know that we are all part of something much, much bigger. But then we forget and fall asleep again. I was starting to wake up more. Not always \u0026ndash; I would go long stretches before suddenly I would wake up again, and I would always be surprised. How could I possibly have forgotten this! How could I not always embrace this joy? Why would I ever forget this? But forget I did, and the cycle would continue. Gradually I started to forget less and less. There is so much joy here that it can be overwhelming and it took me awhile to learn to accept even a tiny fraction. But along with this joy comes a longing. I want other people to find this. I want others to step into the joy that is just there waiting for them. But how? How do I help people find this place within themselves? I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThen I found psychedelics. As I was coming back to normal space from my very first guided journey I knew I had finally found the answer. Medicine work, if properly done is a safe way to let people directly experience what I am talking about. This work is going to change the world. Why am I so confident about this? Because it already did once. The 1960\u0026rsquo;s was a fascinating decade. It started out as a conformist continuation of the post war 1950\u0026rsquo;s but ended up radically changing the world. Think of the difference between early Beatle songs like She Loves You in 1963 to I am the Walrus in 1967. Only four years apart and yet these songs are in completely different worlds. And it started with psychedelics, like LSD and Peyote. This medicine is so powerful that it can cause damage if not treated with the proper respect. Many people hurt themselves and there was a strong backlash. But therapists have shown that if done with profound respect and care, psychedelic therapy enables life changing transformations. People who have struggled to heal for years and years are now finally finding their way to internal peace. I believe in this approach so much that I trained to become a Medicine Guide myself.\nSoftware Engineer While I was participating in all those workshops and having those spiritual breakthroughs I was ashamed of being a software engineer. It seemed like that kind of work is so different from what is actually useful. I thought the world needs more therapists and gifted workshop leaders, not more computer programmers. And it does. But then I had an epiphany — my engineering mindset is what I have to offer the world. The world needs many things right now, and it turns out that engineers can offer something as well. I am under no delusion that this is the only useful mindset. But it is a useful way of looking at the world. We might actually need more of it. I will talk about that next.\n"

	"content": "If you walk into a bookstore you will find books on saving yourself, but not on saving the world. You will find books addressing specific problems, but not on how all these problems relate together as a whole. There are a few books like that of course. I have made a point of finding them. But they are not well known and definitely not best sellers. Why is that? Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have even one well known plan to save the world? Partly because it is just too overwhelming. We are all stuck in the trance of helplessness. Our shared story is still way too small. But another part is that most of us don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience working with complex systems. Some people do though \u0026ndash; programmers. We have to. No one every formally taught me how to manage complex systems, but out of necessity I learned it over time. I learned that any problem at its heart is because people are far from perfect and you have to figure out how to compensate for our human weaknesses. It turns out that is true of all our problems, not just computer ones. Later on I discovered there is a name for this kind of thinking. It is called Systems Thinking. It recognizes that when you are dealing with the \u0026ldquo;wicked problems\u0026rdquo; of the world you first have to understand the whole system. The temptation is to just pick a part of the problem and get to work because the need is so urgent, but that ultimately has limits. It can help, but it will not get us all the way where we want. We need to go deeper. We need to use systems thinking. It is the only thing that works. So how do does this method work? Let me give some examples.\nFind the root cause I truly hate getting woken up at 3am to solve a service outage. I especially don\u0026rsquo;t like having to report to senior management why I personally cost the company many hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. And yet this has happened to me. So I am highly motivated after each incident to learn from it what we can do to reduce the chance of it happening again. At my company whenever a bad outage happens we initiate an inquiry process called \u0026ldquo;The Five Whys\u0026rdquo;. This process simply asks \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; five times, but each time the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; is at a deeper level. We first look at the very topmost \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;. Why did we have the outage? Maybe the database stopped working which cascaded into the whole system going down. OK, straightforward enough, but then we ask \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; again. Maybe a single server in the database went down and automatic failover was not set up. Getting a little deeper now, but again we ask \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;. Why did we miss turning on auto failover? It turns out no one thought to test what happens when just one database server goes down. Now we are deeper yet, but again we ask \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;. Why did we not do the testing? Maybe we did not have a properly thought out testing plan. Getting close now, but there is still another \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; to ask. Why did we not have a proper test plan? It turns out that many software developers like myself are secretly loathe to do proper testing. It is hard enough to get the dumb thing working, and we unconsciously resist deliberately breaking our beautiful software. So we suck at testing. But it turns out there are some pathological individuals (testers) who actually love to break software. They delight in it. Put those guys in charge of the testing plan and everything runs much smoother.\nDo you see how each \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; brings us to a deeper level? When we get deep enough we can get to the heart of the problem, and that is where we can make the real fix. If we just said, \u0026ldquo;Oops, didn\u0026rsquo;t set up the database correctly!\u0026rdquo; we don\u0026rsquo;t solve the real problem. And the next time we release a new program that yet again has not been properly tested we will yet again get woken up at 3am. Get woken up enough times and eventually programmers learn to look at things in a deeper way. Again, it is the only thing that works. There is no magic in the number five. Sometimes you can get there with fewer than five whys sometimes you need more. This kind of thinking is so necessary when working with complex systems. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like most people are aware of it yet. Let me next give a real world example.\nDuring the Trump presidency it felt like political commentators were crashing around their bedroom at night trying to get to the bathroom. Blind to what they were stumbling into over and over. Many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed his movement as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of authoritarian governments in the world recently. Others only focused on recent events without realizing that this is an age old problem. It turns out that it is rare for a democracy to not succumb to authoritarian collapse at some point. And even more failed to recognize that this authoritarian mindset has been with us from the very beginnings of recorded history. We need to stop and take the time to turn on the light and see where we are. What exactly are we bumping into? We see this authoritarian mindset, are there other mindsets that are also driving the world? We need a map. If we truly want to succeed in winning hearts and minds we need to meet people where they actually are not where we think they should be. In my experience telling people that they are crazy and evil just has not been an effective way to get them to change. Have you had a different experience? This is where theory and models can help. We need a better understanding of why people do what they do.\nWillingness to be wrong Why did I decide to create a web site instead of writing a book? Systems thinking. Books are written primarily by one person and then sent off into the capitalist marketplace as a finished product. That is not what we need here. That is working at the wrong level. We instead need a living document that can grow and change. And I need a system that accounts for my weaknesses and ignorance. Fortunately, one thing I have had to get good at as an engineer is admitting that I am wrong. That I made a mistake, sometimes a very big one. To this day there is a sting to it, but after all these years this sting is very familiar to me. And especially on new projects it is quite often necessary to change your mind on major parts of the project. Oddly, I think that this engineering mindset can serve well here. I am proposing a very new, big plan. I\u0026rsquo;m pulling from well established wisdom traditions, but quite probably the way I am pulling them together is going to need a lot of review. Software engineers know a lot about how to work with a situation like this. Projects like this get better and better the more eyes you put on it. And the best way to harness that phenomenon? Open Source.\n"

	"content": "A woman I was exploring dating with asked me what my accomplishments were. I struggled to come up with an answer. I love computer programming and have done some good work on some fun projects, but I don’t really hold on to any part of my career as an “accomplishment”. The woman abruptly cut off contact after that — she needed someone who has “accomplished” something in life. That stung but it was fine, I already had recognized that she had way too much ego attachment for a relationship to work. But it was an interesting question so I kept on thinking about it, and eventually I came up with something. I have worked hard my whole life to get to the truth of the matter. And that really does feel like an accomplishment. Now that I am in the “charting the course for others” phase of my life I look around and see that others seem to struggle with this. There are a couple of reasons for that, but maybe the biggest is that finding our truth requires us to recognize how much we are constantly lying to ourselves. All. the. time. And how do we work with this? Mindfulness.\nThere is a real discomfort to this. When we lie to ourselves we would much prefer that we don’t notice the lie. That is the whole point after all. Let me give an example. When I wrote about my mom asking me to get serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures, I realized that I never confronted her about that. I quickly told myself that I was protecting her feelings. But then I caught the tell-tale whiff of lying to myself yet again. Yes, protecting my mom was part of it, but even bigger than that I was protecting myself. So I was lying to myself in my favorite way — partial disclosure. And even the fact that I never even considered asking her was part of an internal conspiracy to stave off the pain. That whole thing was incredibly painful, why on earth would I want to wallow in it? No, I don’t need to wallow in my suffering, but I do want to step into all that I am. I don’t want to hide from myself parts that are inconvenient or hard to accept.\nTo get to where we need to go I’m asking you to step into the more difficult truths. Again, if this all gets too much, please, please take care of yourself. We usually lie to ourselves for a very good reason. And that is OK. Truly. And yet, as much as you safely can, please recognize that we all are holding back from any number of truths. This work takes patience and gentleness. The more we try to force it the harder we fight. The trick is to just stay curious and mindful. Huh. What was that right now? Notice how I quickly swept that thought away? Hmm. What is going on here? I sense there is something more here. Do you see how this works? The very first thing is to not beat yourself up around the lying. I had very good reasons to lie to myself — a part of me was trying to protect me from a lot of pain. And going into this deeper truth can be very hard and painful. So why on earth would you do this work? Because it is a path to joy.\nSometimes there is a gift in even the hardest thing. Let me give you an example. There was a time in my life when I was so sick that I could barely function. I had just gotten laid off and needed to find another job, but I was suddenly so sick all the time that I couldn’t get it together to even interview. It turns out that I had mercury poisoning probably from a botched filling removal (old school dental amalgams are 50% mercury!), but I didn’t know that at the time. All I knew was that my immune system was so compromised that I kept on getting sick over and over. I would get well for a few days and then bam! I was sick all over again. It was a scary time. I had barely enough savings to not work for two years, and I used all of that up and then went into debt. I had so little energy and it kept on getting less and less. It was like living on a very small island where the water keeps on rising. Every day I was forced with a choice: stay in my current mental habits and drown or change my habits and step onto land. Despite myself I was forced to a healthier mindset. Anything that required too much mental energy just had to go. It turns out that judgment and future tripping require a surprising amount of energy so I simply stopped doing them — I just didn’t have the energy to spare for it.\nWe figured out the mercury thing and I started doing the really hard, grinding process of chelation to remove it. Chelation uses a simple chemical to stir up all the mercury sequestered in the body and bring it into the blood system so it can be removed. It basically requires going through mercury poisoning over and over again. But it worked, and on one beautiful day I realized I had a lot of extra energy. So what did I do with this energy? I splurged on lots of judgments of others and future tripping! It felt like way overdosing on desserts, and no longer was as satisfying as it used to be. Something had shifted in me, and I could feel the difference. I was now very aware of the impact of judging others has on me — it is really draining.\nThis was a huge gift. And there was more; because I could stop judging others I also stopped judging myself so harshly. I accepted that I was scared and felt small. I finally, finally accepted that I was truly not perfect. Not even close. I was very deeply humbled. I felt affinity with the homeless people who also had also been crushed by life. I no longer judged myself superior. These were all such profound gifts. As I started to come back to health I went into a lot of joy. Part of that was simply no longer taking for granted my health. Every day of health was a precious gift. But part of it was that I managed to keep some of that humility and let go some of my pretensions to superiority. Let go of the comforting lie that only others have darkness in them, not me. Let go of the illusion that I don’t have any monsters lurking around inside me. Because I absolutely do. We all do. And a good way to find them is to notice how they show up in our body, particularly around sex. Let’s go back there next.\n"

	"content": "There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent articlehere. I also love what he has to say about meditation which is a practical tool to help us cultivate mindfulness. In his vivid way he describes all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental of meditation. But in that article at the very end he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, too much meditation can lead to spiritual emergencies that without proper help can crush someone or even lead them to suicide. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong \u0026ndash; I love meditation. I meditate daily in front of my beloved altar and it has helped me a lot. It is just that I have seen too many people take up meditation as The One True Way, when it is just one of the ways, and not even a complete way at that.\nHakomi\u0026rsquo;s way is to simply bring more awareness to what is going on. Clients are constantly coached to pay attention to the moment. To really notice what is going on with their bodies and to just get curious. To recognize our internal voice that is always talking and to realize it is just one voice telling a story that is not necessarily true. The therapist acts as a support to help lean into the things that are hurting. The therapist first checks to see if it is OK to proceed (non-violence principle) and then maybe asks the client to breathe into the pain. Asks in different ways to get curious about whatever is happening in the moment (truth principle). And just like yoga starts off awkward and stumbling but eventually becomes much more smooth, if you do this kind of inquiry enough you start to develop the habit of mindfulness. You start to notice what is happening even without the therapist directing you.\nBuddhists refer to this process as RAIN. I particularly like Tara Brach\u0026rsquo;s version of it. If you have not read any of her books please do \u0026ndash; she is one of our most important leaders. Tara teaches RAIN as \u0026ndash; Recognize, Accept, Integrate, Nurture/Non-identify.\nRecognize First we have to simply recognize what is going on with ourselves. What are we feeling in our body? What tensions are we holding and where? What thoughts are slipping in almost unnoticed? What are we resisting feeling right this moment?\nAccept Then we work on fully accepting what is happening right now. Instead of running away from all that overwhelming anger, shame, and hurt we instead step into it. Knowing that as hard as it is we can bear it. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to hide from it \u0026ndash; that hiding and resisting actually isn\u0026rsquo;t helping us. We try to make this bargain that if we push off the pain it can\u0026rsquo;t get to us, but we spend so much energy on that, that it makes it even worse. In the end the only way is to go through the pain. To let ourselves feel all of it. Ouch. Truly ouch. Breathe and accept it all and after the initial shock we might find that we come to a sort of peace with it. Sometimes this is too hard to do alone so we use a therapist or Medicine to help.\nInvestigate Now that we have stopped fighting the pain, we can start to get curious. What is going on here? Where is this all coming from? Does it have to be like this? Surprisingly, quite often the answer is no \u0026ndash; we are caught up in a story that is not true. It is kind of like a trance that we can snap out of if we choose to.\nNurture/Non-identify And now we have the space to nurture that within us that needs nurturing. The poor hurt child that needed that support and love but didn\u0026rsquo;t get it. That part of us that was not allowed to be. A wise Hakomi therapist looks for the missing experience that is longed for. Maybe simply to be hugged. Maybe simply to be told we are lovable and beautiful just the way we are. And then hopefully we can start to let go. We realize that it was just a story, it is not really me. I am not my suffering. Yes my wounds will always be with me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have to hold on to them so tightly. There is space here for something more.\nHakomi never explicitly refers to RAIN but it is almost eery how similar it is. The one key difference, though, is that Hakomi constantly brings us back to our body. Some meditation practices have people ignore their body. That might make sense for a dedicated spiritual journey, but it does not work for healing. Healing work centers around the body. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to that next.\n"

	"content": "Let\u0026rsquo;s start with Aaron Stark\u0026rsquo;s story. Please watch it.\nDo you see why it has to start here? There are so many, many children that could tell similar stories. This has to stop! These kids need our love and support. But instead just like in Aaron\u0026rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom\u0026rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before. It is almost as if children are their parent\u0026rsquo;s property to do with as they see fit. That is so obviously wrong, and yet I think it is our reality. We, just like that social worker, want to believe the comforting lie that a child is always better off with their mother. But unfortunately quite often that mother was also raised by deeply traumatized parents and so she too is acting out of pain. Not truly wanting to but nevertheless deeply wounding her child. One generation passing its trauma on to the next generation over and over. We need to stop this cycle.\nChildren need advocates outside their families. Every child should have at least one functioning, heart-based adult who advocates for them. At least one, more would be even better. Childcare workers traditionally have been some of the least respected in our society. Notice how little they get paid (if they get paid at all). We have that exactly backwards. The revolutionary vanguard must include preschool and kindergarten teachers. Any council of power has to have them seated at the table.\nThere are, of course, many groups doing great work. They just need a lot more attention and backing. For example, Thread in Baltimore is doing amazing work but most people have never heard of them. Most people do not know the amazing changes they are bringing into kid\u0026rsquo;s lives. The basic idea is that five volunteers are brought together with a 9th grade student who is struggling. The group commits to the process for ten years. The student has to agree to all of this. Then it is up to those five volunteers to support that student in whatever way is needed. Packing lunches, giving rides, providing a shoulder to cry on, whatever it takes to support that kid. For ten years. The stories of success are amazing. And make no mistake this is not just for the kids \u0026ndash; the volunteers are getting something incredible from all of this too. It helps to have so many volunteers because that way there is always someone available. The burden never gets too heavy on just one volunteer. Can we just stop for a moment here and appreciate how beautiful this program is? Every child in need should have this. How can we settle for a world that doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide this?\nPeople struggle their whole lives trying to recover from their traumas. This is so wasteful. We would be so better off preventing the trauma in the first place. But we live in a hurting world. So many people are broken and suffering. So much trauma has already happened. We need to heal these people. It has to start here. So how do we do that? The Hakomi principles guide the way.\n"

	"content": "But I didn\u0026rsquo;t know all this when I was sitting back there on that picnic bench at U. of C. It took a long personal journey before I learned to trust other sources of knowledge other than pure reason. To most people this is hardly a discovery - my wife laughs that I was ever in doubt about it. But, I wish someone would have explained this to me when I was younger. Up until this crisis of faith I had been a strict rationalist; Spock was my role model. In short, I was a nerd. I could literally spend all day wrapped up in abstract though, and I loved every second of it. This wasn’t, unfortunately, something I could share with most people. My high school was an inner-city, working class school. Intellectuals were not well tolerated, and I kept my love of ideas fairly well hidden. But I also lived in another world as well, the world of sports. Once, while I was on the football team, I got tired of waiting for the bus. It seemed like we were always waiting in the pseudo military that was football. One day, throwing caution to the wind, I pulled out a trashy sci-fi book (for some reason I thought it would help that the book was trashy) to read. Friends on the team came over to check in with me sincerely worried that there might be something wrong - they were really, touchingly concerned. The next day the coach accosted my father in the hallway (my father worked as the music supervisor for the district), and said in the bluff joking jock style \u0026ldquo;Do you know what the hell your son was doing the other day?!? He was reading!!, That\u0026rsquo;s what. What the hell has gotten into him!!?\u0026rdquo;. He was half serious. My worst fears were confirmed.\nIt was remarkably like being gay and in the closet. I was too scared to openly declare myself an intellectual, so I kept it hidden. So of course, I took that as my central identity. I longed to be an openly flaming intellectual, and looked for my version of San Francisco. The University of Chicago seemed to fit the bill nicely. The school was so intellectually pure they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any practical art or music classes, only art and music theory. At the time they didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a separate computer science department – that was much too applied. All computer courses were taught by the (purer) math department instead. But that was ok with me. I wanted to, finally, be surrounded by serious intellectuals. Finally, I was going to get to the good stuff. The only problem was that nobody seemed to be very happy \u0026ndash; those grey minds always were beating down.\nBefore college I used to think that the world would be a much, much better place if everyone was just like me - oh sure, it would be a more boring, predictable world, but at least it would be saner. I was wrong. U. of C. gave me a glimpse of what a world of many me\u0026rsquo;s might be like - and it turns out that too many brooding intellectuals in one place is not a good idea at all. They need leavening! What goes missing is joy, beauty, and simple silliness. I remember sitting in on a difficult, advanced philosophy class (studying another book of Immanuel Kant) and looking around thinking about the professor and graduate students. Here they had dedicated their lives to pure reason, and yet they looked miserable. One look at these people and I realized that no matter how much I enjoyed philosophy I definitely did not want to lead lives like theirs. Clearly something was wrong with the path they were on but what? Maybe pure reason was not the answer after all?\nAfter my second year at U. of C., I dropped out. I took a year off and explored for a while. On my way to Olympic National Park to do some hiking in Washington State, I discovered The Evergreen College and fell in love with it almost from the moment I entered its extensive, verdant forests. For someone from Illinois, Washington has an incredible, almost absurd wealth of trees. Evergreen is a very non-traditional school. Instead of signing up for separate, individual classes, Evergreen offers seminars that are focused on investigating a key question or two. Looking through the catalog I found one seminar, called Computability and Cognition. This seminar had two main questions: “What are the limits of Reason?” and “What do computers have to teach us about human thinking?” Bingo. These were definitely the questions that I wanted to spend time studying.\nI wanted to do what he is doing. "

	"content": "All of the stages come with both gifts and shadows. I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.\nBeige The shadow version of this stage is what happens when we collapse down to survival mode. Only me and mine matter. Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what happens to those other because they are not really human. Given a chance they would suck out our brains so we have to fight back with everything we have.\nThere is an enormous selfishness that can show up at this level. An incredible indifference to the pain of others. A lot of the world spends at least part of the time here. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how much money you have, if you spend your life in constant fear you are living in survival mode. Unless and until we get people out of this hurt and lack we can\u0026rsquo;t expect them to do anything else.\nShadows Only out for themself Stuck in survival mode Purple People are desperately hungry for tribe. This is a driving need. If people can\u0026rsquo;t find a healthy way to express this need they will make do with an unhealthy way. Somehow, some way this need must be met. We are seeing a world wide resurgence of ethnic nationalism \u0026ndash; which is an unhealthy expression of this tribal hunger. It explains some (but not all) of the attraction to Trump. His rallies were a potent drug. People felt part of a tribal whole and they were desperately missing that. How do we counter this? I will talk about deeper solutions in later sections, but possibly the simplest intervention is to get people to switch to a healthier tribe. The most successful way to get people to leave a white nationalist groups is to find a different group for them to join. The thing they really are looking for is that sense of group pride, belonging and togetherness.\nShadows violent, ethnic nationalism (eg. white supremacy) only concerned about my tribe Red This is the big one. For some reason in the U.S. when we reach for an example of ultimate evil we go to the Nazis. As if we don\u0026rsquo;t have something even worse (if that is possible) in our own history. Slavery. Genocide. And that slave owner mindset is still very much with us even today. This darkness has been with us a long time. We are taught to revere the Greek and Roman empires. Yes they had amazing achievements, but they were also brutal slave regimes. Just like us. We are all complicit.\nI am writing this in the winter of 2021. It is not clear to me whether democracy will survive in the U.S. The Republicans are in the midst of purging from their party anyone who tells the truth about Trump\u0026rsquo;s lies. And the voters seem to be fine with this. The 2022 elections will almost certainly sweep in a Republican majority in the house, and quite possibly the senate as well. The majority of Republicans voted to overturn the 2020 election. After all these purges there is no doubt that they will be even more aggressive to overturn the 2024 election. Or they might not even need to. Like I said many voters seem to be fine with all of these shenanigans. And this is not unique to the U.S. Authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. Russia, an emboldened China, India, Poland, Hungary, Philippines, Brazil, Turkey are examples of states either firmly authoritarian or succumbing to it just like us.\nSo we all have a front row seat to the shadow of Red. The first thing we notice are the lies. But Red doesn\u0026rsquo;t think of it that way. They think they are creating their own reality. Consider this conversation with a George W. Bush aide\nThe aide said that guys like me were \u0026ldquo;in what we call the reality-based community,\u0026rdquo; which he defined as people who \u0026ldquo;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.\u0026rdquo; I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not the way the world really works anymore,\u0026rdquo; he continued. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you\u0026rsquo;re studying that reality \u0026ndash; judiciously, as you will \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that\u0026rsquo;s how things will sort out. We\u0026rsquo;re history\u0026rsquo;s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are an empire now, and we when we act, we create our own reality.\u0026rdquo; That is the heart of Red. Truth as something greater than yourself is just not something that Red has online yet. So when Trump lies his followers celebrate it as a sign of strength. They applaud Trump for creating his own reality. And they laugh at the rest of us trying to study what he just did.\nShadows slave owner mindset lies authoritarianism Blue In the 1400\u0026rsquo;s China was the dominant world power. The emperor sent enormous fleets all the way to India and Africa. The size and technical sophistication of this fleet eclipsed anything the Europeans or any other country had. The Chinese knew about Europe, but it was much too poor to bother with. China could have ruled the wold if they wanted. Instead subsequent emperors disbanded the fleets and strictly forbade all exploration. It cost them. The empire stagnated and when Europeans finally managed to launch much, much smaller exploratory fleets of their own, they found a China easy to bully and ultimately colonize. Blue can be wonderfully stable and it can provide much better governance than despotic Red, but it can easily go stagnant and complacent. And even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go stagnant that inward focus holds back progress as Japan found out when those American \u0026ldquo;Black Ships\u0026rdquo; came barging into Tokyo harbor.\nBlue encourages a kind of magical thinking. Everything is going to be OK because \u0026ndash; fill in the blank. Everything is going to be OK because China is the center of the world and always will be. Climate change is OK because God will take care of us. Billions of people dying is regrettable but OK because Buddha taught us to accept suffering. Blue also expects unquestioning obedience. Go over to Vietnam and start shooting people. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask questions about why we are doing this just start shooting! Father knows best, no more questions. There can be a rigidity and intolerance. Anyone not following the True path is impure and needs to be purged.\nShadows stagnancy magical thinking blind obedience rigidity Orange Orange gets caught in the trap that only scientific thinking is valid. This kind of thinking ruthlessly splits the world into separate, dead parts. The universe is a cold uncaring place and you die alone. Progress is measured primarily in economic terms. Greed is Good. How much stuff do you have? How big is your bank account? There are many, many authors that do an excellent job of describing this mentality so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much time on this. Basically if you have read any environmentalist you should be familiar with this critique. I think the environmentalists are clearly right, but hopefully you already understand this.\nThe other part is that just as the shadow of Red continues the mindset of the slave owner, the shadow of Orange continues the mindset of the imperialistic colonizer. The mindset of take anything I want. The mindset of the white man\u0026rsquo;s burden. This mindset of appropriation without giving credit is still very much alive today. For example the otherwise very good Dialectical Behavior Therapy makes almost no mention of the enormous debt it owes to Buddhism. The heart of the practice is clearly ripped straight out of Buddhist practice, but you would not know that if you read any of the descriptions of it. This is the arrogant mindset that until the enlightened scientist came along none of this mindfulness stuff was true. Oh sure those primitive Buddhists might have accidentally stumbled onto a couple of useful things, but it is the scientist\u0026rsquo;s burden to get all of this properly sorted. What nonsense.\nShadows scientific materialism greed is good colonizer mindset Green When I first drove to the Evergreen State University, I was dumbstruck by all the trees. Even after I got to the school boundary I still had to drive through several miles of trees before I got to the main campus. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have trees like that in Illinois. Land is so valuable for farming that very few trees are suffered to live. Lots of trees on a property were a display of conspicuous wealth. With all those miles of trees surrounding us, the campus felt very safe. I felt very protected from the outside world. Until a female student got raped right on campus. It badly shocked all of us. How could this happen? How could that happen here? Where was our protection?\nThe community did not handle the event well. Unfortunately as is all too common in trauma, hurt people lash out. Evergreen was one of the most liberal colleges in the country and it attracted a sizable number of radical feminists. That part was good. What was not so good was that many of these women believed it was OK to be angry at men simply because they were men. So the response to the rape was to organize a take back the night march, but no men allowed. All men were strictly forbidden to even be on campus during the march. Getting lumped in with the rapist hurt me to my core. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one hurt. Years later a close friend of mine confessed that he had (disobediently) chosen to stand in silent support along the march route and he received glare after glare of pure hatred. It hurt him deeply, and that hurt stayed with him all his life. I imagine that many of those glaring women had been victims of assault so their anger is very understandable. Anger is necessary, but we need to learn to be more skillful with it. Otherwise we just continue the cycle of pain. Hurt people hurt other people. But that is not what we want. We want a world with more love not less.\nTime for confession. I know all about lashing out in anger because I do it too. During the pandemic I found myself crunching the numbers to see how many people dying from Covid were Trump supporters. I wanted to see if the number of their deaths would change anything politically. The super dark side of this? I was hoping it would. Just to be crystal clear on this, I was secretly hoping for vast numbers of people to die based solely on their tribal identity. The more the better. Do you know who else had this kind of mindset? Hitler. Pretty dark, right? I can\u0026rsquo;t just point my fingers at others, this shadow lives in me as well.\nGreen is supposed to help us out of our misguided stereotypes, but it can end up still stuck there. For example, I present as male, but the reality is a lot more complicated than that. As a child I was very gentle and sensitive. I remember one summer morning thinking about the two boys next door methodically experimenting with different ways to torture insects. Yuck! If that is what it meant to be a boy maybe I was really a girl? It seemed like a real possibility. I cry easily. I\u0026rsquo;m unusually aware of people\u0026rsquo;s emotions. I read a huge amount (which is way more common for women), and most of my favorite authors are women because they tend to do relationships much better. I have serious womb envy. For a while it was actually painful for me to see pregnant women because I envied them so much. I got caught in school experimenting with cross dressing and got publicly humiliated for it. I could go on. And yet. In high school I found out that I love to wrestle and play football. So there was that. Later on I seriously investigated whether I might be gay, or at least bi, because internally if felt a little weird that I was not. But nope. Very clearly I am hetero. I once confessed to a gay friend that I felt most comfortable with gay men even though I am hetero. I was a little afraid he would not understand me, but he just laughed and said, \u0026ldquo;You have no idea of how many men have told me that. I think there should be a third sex\u0026rdquo;. That hit me like lightening. Yes! A third sex! That fits. All of this has been hard for me. We have gotten much better about not holding gender stereotypes against women, but many people seem to be completely unaware that it is equally not OK to have gender stereotypes against men. For example, my crying tends to make people uncomfortable. Men still are not supposed to cry. This runs really deep, even with people who have done a lot of work. In my Medicine guide training many of my fellow students were astonished to find out how strong I am because they were holding the stereotype that men who cry are weak. It took them going way deep into a journey before they could really see me.\nThe shadow of Green is that sometimes it encourages us to stereotype each other by what group we belong to and leaves us even more divided than we were before. We seem to be hard wired to \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; each other. To treat each other as the enemy instead of as part of the solution. We are all too quick to put each other in boxes and judge them. And what a tragedy it is when all we see about a person is their labels. In my Hakomi therapy training a vibrant gay woman took on the challenge of introducing diversity and inclusion into the organization. She did it in a very beautiful way. She first brought in a guest lecturer to teach us how cognitively we are hardwired to \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; each other. We \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; people faster than thought \u0026ndash; scientists can actually measure this. She then talked about her personal experience of going into groups where people were not like her and how she immediately \u0026ldquo;othered\u0026rdquo; that whole group. Held her heart separate from those others in an attempt to protect herself. But that is not what she really wanted. She was working towards a world where people felt safe to love each other. My heart flung wide open and I was eager to listen to everything she had to teach. Not all diversity training are done so skillfully. Most of the other training I have attended were quick to put people into boxes, and people left the training feeling separate and divided, not more loving and whole. That vibrant Hakomi woman was teaching from a place of love so big that it included everyone. Unfortunately Green does not always find its way there. Maybe gets caught in the hurt and doesn\u0026rsquo;t find its way to that bigger place of love that we are all longing for.\nShadows \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; victim mindset intolerance Yellow People are sometimes surprised when I tell them people at Yellow tend towards wild arrogance. Just because someone has done deep work does not make them perfect. And because Yellow does in fact see clearer on some important things than the other levels, it can lead to a false sense of superiority. Sometimes this is blatant. For example, Hanzi Freinach self identifies as Yellow and has some interesting things to say in his book, The Listening Society, but oh my goodness does he have a strong attachment to ego. He talks approvingly of the coming aristocracy of Yellow \u0026ndash; it will be people at Yellow like himself (and his billionaire patron presumably) who rule the world.\nThis sense of superiority also shows up in more subtle ways. For example at this level you will likely hear talk about \u0026ldquo;evolutionary\u0026rdquo; leaders. This is the belief that evolution started with slow, gradual genetic changes, but now evolution is showing up as culture change and it is accelerating as our minds go through new stages of consciousness. This way of thinking holds that people at Yellow are literally, not just figuratively, but literally more \u0026ldquo;evolved\u0026rdquo; than, say, people at Purple. That progress has been a steady evolution from bands to tribes to villages to empires to nation states. And that there is an evolutionary impulse that is bringing us to these higher and higher states. Substitute \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;evolution\u0026rdquo; and this argument should sound familiar. Ken Wilber is a proponent of this viewpoint. He is hugely influential and his writings form some of the foundations of my thinking. Without him I probably would not be writing this document, but he also suffers from ego inflation. This article does a brilliant job of summarizing his immense contributions but also how ultimately his ego got in his own way.\nAnd because Yellow is such a strong pendulum swing back to individual focus (tick), it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to do groups well. This can sometimes be disastrous. Let me give you an example. Aharon Grossbard and his wife Francoise Bourzat trained people how to safely sit for people as a Medicine guide. A community of practitioners grew up around them. Francoise and Aharon then trained other people to be the teachers and set up a formal curriculum. There were high standards required of the guides. You did not necessarily have to be a credentialed therapist (although that was preferred), but at a minimum you were required to do at least two years of intensive training on how to be a therapist. And you were to hold yourself to the same high ethical standards that a therapist does. That is how I came into the program. I am not a credentialed therapist but I spent two years learning the basics of how to be one. After that you had one year of practical medicine training and after graduating you were required to have at least two years of both group and individual supervision. The community had an executive group and an ethics committee. And the community was thriving. Therapists were reporting back that their patients were making exciting breakthroughs that just did not seem to come with just talk therapy. And then this article by Will Hall came out alleging that Aharon had abused him both sexually and emotionally. That opened the flood gates. It turns out that Aharon had been abusing a large number of male clients. And it emerged that Francoise had not disclosed that she had been kicked out of Hakomi because of multiple ethical lapses. Unfortunately this is all too common a story. The founding guru/teacher gets caught up in their own ego and goes badly astray.\nThe community\u0026rsquo;s initial response to all of this was surprisingly good. Almost immediately the community asked their guru founders to step down and refrain from any Medicine work. They also brought in a very strong restorative justice team to help clean up the mess. This is the strength of Yellow \u0026ndash; most groups would not be able to be as honest with themselves. But then it emerged that the community had an even bigger problem. It was not just Francoise and Aharon who were crossing sexual (and other) boundaries, but some other rogue guides as well. And some guides had been graduated who probably should not have. In at least one case a guide had raped his clients and the community had not properly dealt with this. Horrible. What was the reaction to this even bigger problem? The leadership disbanded the entire community in a single email. Just like that. No group discussions, no effort to grapple with the deeper problems here they just ran away. This is about the worst possible outcome I can imagine. Now you have all these scattered Medicine guides practicing on their own with no group to hold them accountable. No group to help them continue to learn and grow. Nothing to protect people from rogue bad guides. Nothing to protect people even from well meaning guides who just need more guidance. It was a deeply immoral, irresponsible decision. This is the shadow side of Yellow. It can so easily disavow any greater responsibility for its actions.\nShadows arrogance ego inflation lack of true accountability. Turquoise I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about Turquoise to know what shadows it will have, but it will definitely have them. It is super important to recognize this and have compassion about the fact that we are all very imperfect. We all have blindspots (except me of course). Any movement inspired by Turquoise will need to welcome all voices, and to be especially careful to listen and respond to feedback. Especially when the feedback is hard to hear. Hopefully, Turquoise will learn from Yellow and not get caught in the trap of ego attachment, so that when Turquoise fucks up \u0026ndash; and it will fuck up \u0026ndash; the movement can self correct with compassion for all involved.\nShadows We don\u0026rsquo;t know yet, but we need to plan for this "

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Blue TrueBlue Church,Schools The Truth There is a Truth that is eternal and greater than us. This is what we wake up to in the Blue stage. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was localized. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.\nGod is one path to this Truth, but not the only way. Buddha woke up under a Bodhi tree just as himself, not a god. He taught a practical path to enlightenment that anyone willing to do the work can follow. Plato based his work on the very Blue notion that the world is just a shadowy reflection of the ideal. The Greeks had no shortage of eloquent smart thinkers, but when those thinkers only focused on selfish, individual ends they just ended up with sophistry. Nothing useful could be built on that. Plato and Aristotle gave the world a glimpse of what is possible when you base your ideas on the foundation of Truth. Science needs this stage first before it can flourish.\nAnd then there was Christ. Imagine his time. Rome was confidently in charge of its brutal slave empire. And the people suffered. Christianity has a lot to answer for, but consider what happened at the very, very beginning of this religion. Some how, some way this man inspired a revolution that spread throughout the Western world. Women and slaves were recognized as beloved of God. Might makes right was no longer the highest truth. The cross which was a torture device used to keep people in line now became a defiant symbol of redemption. What an incredibly sneaky way to revolt against the empire! No armies were needed. Instead people were ready and willing to die for a belief. And the world was changed.\nMohammed is a similar story. Just like Christ he went into the wilderness to find himself and when he came back he had an amazing story to tell. And people flocked to him because they hungered for the Truth he was teaching. From many warring tribes people joined together to become a community of believers. And they were kind to each other. Now orphans and widows were fed and protected. And because it worked and answered the longing for a meaningful life, this new religion spread throughout Arab lands and beyond.\nConsider Confucius. Genghis Khan managed only to conquer the Northern part of China. After his death it was left to his son, Ögedei, to continue. The south turned out to be too strong to be conquered by simple Red tactics alone. Instead, Ögedei was taught the very blue Confucian way. He ended up conquering the south by becoming more Chinese than the Chinese. People long for a just, moral society.\nJapan had a terrible period of civil war (the Sengoku Jidai) starting in the mid 1400\u0026rsquo;s. The country suffered through countless battles for control until 1615 when Tokugawa finally managed to conquer the country for good. He established a very Blue neo-confucianist regime that launched Japan into over two centuries of peace and prosperity. He saw what was happening to lands to the south as the western traders made their way up the Asian coast, and it spurred him to do something that sounds crazy but was kind of genius. He shut the country tightly down. No one got in (especially westerners) and no one got out. And it worked. Japan enjoyed over 250 years of peace and prosperity without outside interference. It worked and worked until suddenly one day it no longer did. One day American battleships (the \u0026ldquo;Black Ships\u0026rdquo;) steamed into Tokyo harbor completely ignoring Japan\u0026rsquo;s strenuous objections. And on that day Japan was forced to make a choice. Change or die.\n"

	"content": "When I was in college I went to the Zen center at Green Gulch north of San Francisco to meditate for a week. I knew how rigorous it was going to be so I diligently practiced zazen until I could sit for almost an hour in perfect stillness. I was quite proud of my ability. At the zen center we sat so quietly that even if someone swallowed you could hear it so I tried to not even do that. Then one morning a middle-aged woman came in who wasn’t as skilled and she shifted and moved around trying to get comfortable quite a bit. What a racket! But after a few days she settled in and got quieter and quieter until one morning at breakfast she remarked, “I heard the ocean this morning!”. A fellow student replied, “It was always there you just needed to get quiet enough to hear it”. And it was true the sound of ocean waves crashing into the beach was always there in the distance but you did have to be very, very still to hear it. In the very same way we need to get still enough to hear what is really going on for us. Usually we are too busy shifting around to get comfortable for us to pay attention.\nThat woman later asked for chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Scandalous! What an interesting story I was telling myself. That simple pleasure was not allowed. Fortunately the cooks were wiser than me and obliged. But here is the interesting thing. Have you ever eaten something, super slowly and with exquisite focus? If you try that with a normal chocolate chip cookie your head will explode. They are way, way too sweet and intense for that. They are designed to blast past our normal inattentiveness and grab us by the throat so we can’t help but notice them. What the Zen cooks baked, however, was a cookie that invited you to really deeply pay attention to it. You had to get quiet enough to appreciate it.\nWe find our Truth moment to moment within. Meditation teaches us how to get quiet and still enough to actually hear it, but it is only one of the ways to get there. It is just a tool. The goal is to keep on exploring within. Taking a moment to check in with ourselves and getting quiet enough to really hear those distant ocean waves. Asking ourself, what is going on with me right now? And then how about now? A compassionate observer always watching and noticing. This is something that should be taught in school but isn’t. This is practice that we need to cultivate.\nHakomi therapists teach mindfulness by example. The therapist looks for the right moment to pause us in our story and have us notice what is going on in our body right now. Have us notice what stories are running through our head. And then encourages us to keep on tracking. Notice those quick little deadly thoughts that slip in and out and then noticing how our body reacts to those thoughts as well. How we get tense or fearful or angry. We start to realize our body and mind are not really separate things. Let’s talk about that next.\n"

	"content": "More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990\u0026rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet. Open Source out competed fierce capitalistic companies because it is a better way of collaborating. It is the only instance that I know of where communism won. No one owns open source software; people freely donate their time to it as a gift to the world. Ideas work best when they are free. And frameworks work best when many people have taken a serious look at them and offered improvements. But despite this idealism open source exists to be of use. Not all contributions are accepted. It is not like the wikipedia where there are endless, wasteful edit wars over controversial topics. Open source tends to avoid all that and stays focused on delivering value. And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, some other open source project comes along to replace it.\nOpen source does not have to be just for software. I propose that this plan to save the world should be an open source project. So how does that work? This website is hosted on Github, which is where many open source projects live. Every aspect of this site is open to inspection and review. Github supports this kind of collaboration through an intuitive interface. The Github UI is meant to be accessible even to people who are not strongly technical.\nThere are three main ways to interact with this site\nComments Please, please leave a comment below. Even just to say Hi. You have to create an account to do this, but that is to prevent bots from spamming the comments. My apologies for making you do that, but it is necessary. Unprotected websites get horribly spammed. And I hope you do register because I so want to hear your thoughts. This is the easiest level and I hope everyone takes advantage of this.\nIssues All open source project have issues (aka bugs) that they are working on. If you see something that needs to be fixed, or have a suggested improvement, please switch over to the GitHub section of this site (notice that there are links everywhere to do that). Then find the \u0026ldquo;Issues\u0026rdquo; tab and type in your request. This takes a little bit more effort than simply adding a comment, but it makes it much easier to track what are the main things that need work. It also lets other people comment on the issue. You can track when the fix was made. This is the next level of involvement in the project. I would love it if you simply posted an issue just for practice.\nPull requests A \u0026ldquo;Pull request\u0026rdquo; aka (PR) is when someone makes changes to their local version of the project and now are requesting that this change get merged into the master version shared by everyone. It is like you have a copy of a shared word document and you have added a couple of extra pages. And now you want to merge your changes into the shared copy that everyone is using. In open source this is not automatic. Whoever is maintaining that part of the project needs to approve each and every PR. If the changes are simple (eg. spelling and grammar fixes) the PR will likely be merged right away. If the PR makes big structural changes, there likely will be a bunch of back and forth conversation before the PR eventually gets merged. You can make a PR using the Git UI. Go ahead and try it. You are not going to break anything. If you are not serious about your proposed changes just let me know in the PR description.\nCopyright The key legal innovation of open source is to use the very strong legal provisions of copyright law to sort of subvert capitalism. How does it work? Anyone is allowed to use anything on this site. Copy anything you like. You are even encouraged to make money off this site if you can. But. If you use a chunk from this site, you are legally obligated to make your own site (or book or whatever) open source as well. That means that any original stuff that you come up with will also be available for others to copy and use as they see fit. Do you see how this makes the most sense for this kind of work? We need to come together as a community. And we need the freedom to pick and choose whatever content works best without worrying about copyrights.\nDreamcatcher OK, so those are the nuts and bolts of it, but let me step back into the bigger picture again. I believe this world needs a much bigger shared dream than we have been allowing ourselves to dream. We all have our own dreams, now it is time to bring them together. This site is meant as a kind of dream catcher. It feels like we have been singing our dreams separately. Now it is time to pull all those songs together. Just like in a choir, each of our voices is necessary but part of the greater whole. By myself I am just one lonely voice. It is so obvious that I can not do this alone. Maybe my voice starts the song, but then other voices need to join in. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to hear what our voices sound like together.\n"

	"content": "When I finally let it, my body guided me to some “dark” truths about myself. For example, it turns out I love to dominate. I secretly love to force my way on people. And how do I know this? Because of how delightful it feels. It showed up in football, and when I let it, it shows up when I have sex. Initially I was so horrified about this that I carefully kept even a hint of this from myself. But it is there alright. In BDSM there is something called “consensual non-consent”. It means that two parties agree to one forcing themselves upon the other. It is important to note that both parties want this and there are some safety precautions like setting up a “safe” word. But the reality is that we are setting up a rape scene. And I am the rapist. It doesn’t get much darker than that. And yet it lights up both of us. There is something electric about this power dynamic. Our bodies are guiding the way.\nOne of my favorite memories is sitting next to a man at a BDSM “munch” (monthly gathering) and talking about his corset pictures. We were conspiring to attract one of the female doms that he wanted to do a play session with. I loved the frank honesty of the munch group — they were clear what worked for them sexually and were honest about it. I also loved how it was so clear that whether you liked to dominate or submit was not tied to gender. And when I explored further I found I also love to be dominated. There is a real sexual charge for me there as well. People that equally like to dominate and be dominated are called “switches” in the BDSM community. Native Americans had a gender beyond male or female called two spirited that describes me, except for that weird thing that I’m only really sexually attracted to women. And again it is the body that guides on this.\nAnother learning was to see how pleasurable anger can be. When I was biking to work sometimes a car would brush within inches of me. Just the slightest twitch of the wheel would either kill or maim me. And the driver was completely unaware. To them I was just so much possible bug splatter. It would enrage me. I am not a bug! Sometimes I would get so crazy angry that I biked after the car with in a rage. I would have graphic mental images of picking up my bike and repeatedly smashing it into the car over and over. Fortunately cars are much faster than bikes so even if I eventually did catch up with the car, I wasn’t fit to do anything other than gasp for air and the rage would pass. But something I noticed about this rage? It felt really deliciously good. I suspect that this happens at Trump rallies — it feels really good to get angry. I imagine people even get addicted to this feeling.\nFear is another supposedly negative emotion, and yet many people love to get scared by a horror movie, or pay lots of money to go on a scary amusement park ride. I don’t personally enjoy fear the way I do anger, but it also is a valued emotion. Every time I jump off a cliff with my paraglider I am terrified. Ah! I’m way up in the air! It scares the crap out of me. And yet I find myself still wanting to do it. Why? Because there is something so amazing about pushing past my earth bound limits. There is nothing quite like flying. Fear is there to remind me of how dangerous it all is. To not take anything for granted, and pay close attention to safety. And that fear helps me in times of crisis when I’ve jumped into air that I should not have. It helps me really hone in on what I have to do to survive. And dancing with my fear awakens me to my power. I am at my most powerful when I’ve felt the fear and did it anyways.\nWhen I am finally in that powerful state I know that this is what feels right. We all have warriors within us. Not all of us welcome our warrior. But it is what wants to happen if only we would let it. Let’s go to organicity next.\n"

	"content": "We tend to hold our bodies and minds as separate things. They are not. And if our body is suffering we are not up for anything other than simple survival; we certainly are not up for saving the world. I know this personally. In December 2013, I had just gotten laid off and suddenly I was sick all of the time. I would be OK for a couple of days or even a week but then another cold or flu would hit and I would go back to being sick. On top of that I would get bouts of vertigo and have to reach out to something to keep from falling over. I could feel it my body too — something was very wrong. I tried different doctors but nothing really was helping. Finally, six months later, a medical intuitive declared I had mercury poisoning. He had no proof for it but at that point I was ready to investigate any lead so I asked my naturopath to test me for mercury. She told me that first for completeness we will do a blood test, but that never comes up positive because mercury is so toxic that the body quickly sequesters it. After that we can do more sensitive tests to detect for sequestered mercury. But then I got a phone call from her telling me I had to come in right away. The blood test came in with sky high mercury! Levels so high it was alarming. We figured out that it mostly likely had been triggered by a poorly handled filling removal done back in December when this all started. It turns out that old school filling amalgams are roughly 50% mercury! If my mercury blood levels were that high six months later they must have been through the roof way back in December.\nIt was a long recovery. I could not work for two years. Fortunately I had just gotten a chunk of stock option money and that was just enough (barely) to get me through that time. Getting sick over and over showed me what it feels like to walk a few steps towards death. I know that path a little bit better now. Much of the time I had incredibly low energy. But in a weird way that low energy was a blessing. I no longer had the energy to harshly judge others or future trip ( obsess about the future). It turns out that those take an incredible amount of energy. At every moment I had a choice — function or not, and I kept on choosing to function. I gave up harshly judging others not because it is the right thing to do, although it is, but as a simple survival choice. I simply didn’t have the energy to spare for it. I still remember the very first day of my recovery I had a big burst of energy. I ended up splurging on a huge bout of judging others and future tripping. It felt like way overdoing a dessert — fun in the moment, but ultimately didn’t feel very good. Now that I am mostly recovered (I still get sick more than the average person, but I am functioning pretty well), I have kept that habit. I tend to not harshly judge others not because I’m morally superior to others (hah!), but because it feels so much better in my body not to. My long illness taught me this.\nThere were many other blessings as well. The illness had me pay exquisite attention to what foods worked for me. With such low energy I had to be careful to only eat things that worked. I no longer had the luxury of just ignoring when a food was causing me trouble; that could destroy an entire day now. I learned what was important. Connection to nature and exercise were no longer just nice things to do; they were now survival strategies. A very big blessing was how humbled I was. Up to then if this had happened to someone else I just would have (secretly) assumed they were shirking. It was all in their head and they just needed to shake it off and get back to work. Now I knew what it felt like to be on the other side. I was now one of those people. This knocked me off of my high place of superiority and brought me to a much more humble place. I feel more connected and tolerant of homeless people. Maybe the biggest blessing was that I no longer took my health for granted. Every day that I wake up in health is now a cause for deep joy.\nThe body knows what it wants. It wants healthy food, healthy sex, connection to nature, and lots and lots of exercise. Our body knows what foods work for it. If we pay attention, we know when a food doesn’t work for us. Our body (for most people at least) craves healthy, nurturing sex. That might mean a masturbation practice. It is not healthy to feel guilty about it. That sends a harmful, mixed message. Our body craves to be in nature. We notice how good it feels to simply walk amongst the trees. It wants a nonverbal relationship with the more than human world. Our body craves to feel its heart pumping, lungs gasping for air, and plastered with sweat. That feels really, really good. People don’t know that are missing out on a fundamental joy of life. When I work out with weights it not only makes my body feel stronger, it made me feel mentally stronger too. This following our intuition is so key. Hakomi has a weird word for this. They call it \u0026ldquo;organicity\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about that next.\n"

	"content": "In class we studied how formal reasoning works. It turns out that any formal reasoning system starts out with basic assumptions (called axioms) and works up from there. No useful logical system can be built without these assumptions, but these assumptions have to be taken on faith - they are outside of the system. So many arguments are pointless because the participants are starting with radically different assumptions. Given how enormously important our assumptions are, it is shocking how unaware we typically are of them. When I talk about our mental machinery this is a major component.\nTraditionally, rationalists start with the assumption that only their rational mind can be trusted as a source of truth. Everything else is fallible. Descartes “Meditations” is a great example of this mindset. The legend is that the philosopher Descartes had a bad cold, and was cooped up in a rustic cabin. His thoughts started to turn a little weird and he came up with this little essay titled “Meditations”. Descartes points out in this essay that when you think carefully about it, you start to realize that there really is no way to know that anything is actually as it seems. You don’t even know what you are seeing is real because just like in the Matrix movie it might turn out that everything is getting fed to you by some malevolent power.\nThe problem, though, as Descartes himself points out is that given this mindset you start to doubt that anything up to and possibly including even yourself is real. Descartes concludes that the only thing he can know for sure is that he is thinking – hence the famous \u0026ldquo;I think therefore I am\u0026rdquo; quote. Note that this is a very different mindset from \u0026ldquo;I have a body therefore I am\u0026rdquo;. Doubting that anything at all in the world except your own mind is real is a pretty weird view on life, and I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly recommend it. But many followers of pure reason find themselves sliding here. Without realizing it they get caught in a trap; at their core they only have faith in their rationality to guide them and so everything else including their own senses comes into suspicion.\nIn the Computability and Cognition seminar at Evergreen we also looked at what computers could tell us about reasoning. Could computers be as smart as humans? Could they even pass for human? At the time (mid ‘80’s), a surprisingly large number of people thought so. The thinking was that human intelligence can be completely captured by mathematical symbols. The actual physical substrate is almost irrelevant - it is the pure reason behind it that is all that matters. Since the 1950\u0026rsquo;s computer scientists have been arrogantly predicting the imminent dawn of Artificial Intelligence, and they\u0026rsquo;ve always been embarrassingly wrong. The only examples that we have of consciousness (ourselves and animals) are very biological, why would we immediately assume that the body has absolutely nothing to do with consciousness? What proof do we have of this? The answer is so far absolutely none.\nWe stand profoundly ignorant of our own minds. In our arrogance we assume that the same methods that teased out the secrets of the stars would work just as well to tease out the secrets of the soul. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened that way. We don\u0026rsquo;t understand how and why we have consciousness. We certainly can\u0026rsquo;t artificially create consciousness, nor have we come close to doing so. We don\u0026rsquo;t, in short, have a mathematics of the mind. Until we do develop such a system we need to stand humbly and admit how much we still do not know. Really, this is the only possible rational response - don\u0026rsquo;t assume we know something when we in fact do not.\nThe seminar culminated with Goedel\u0026rsquo;s theorem. It turns out that there are mathematical truths that cannot be proven correct. Let me say that again because it is very important. Something can be a true statement in a formal reasoning system, but you can not use that formal reasoning system to prove it so. In other words, any system of rational thought can not answer all questions, even some rational questions.\nWhy do I think this is so important? If you remember earlier I talked about how philosophers try to closely mimic math proofs. But here was a mathematical proof that showed that it is impossible to reach out to all truths by using just one system. Reasoning systems are inherently incomplete – they have to be supplemented by other methods. Again this might sound painfully obvious, but it really isn’t. How do I know if something is true? Some of us are truth seekers – we are determined to get to the deeper truth of things no matter where that might take us. And reasoning, despite its difficulty, is very attractive to us because it lets us “feel” the inherent truth of things. But now I was learning, if you restrict yourself to just using rationality, you are never going to reach important truths – and this can be proven mathematically!\nWhen I realized that reason in fact has limits to what it can tell me, I became curious to explore what else was out there. For a time, I became a very serious Zen Buddhist, and meditated diligently. It was a revelation that I could calm my chattering mind and enter into another, larger mental space. Zen meditation requires an almost athletic ability to focus the mind and body to absolute stillness. At the peak of my ability, I spent a week at a Zen monastery just north of San Francisco, and every morning we would start the day by meditating for two early hours in the austere but beautiful temple. One morning at breakfast a woman who had been noisily struggling with the severe discipline of Zen meditation asked if everyone had heard the ocean this morning. One of the monks smiled and simply said the ocean had always been there she just had gotten quiet enough to hear it. And it was true, you had to get very, very quiet and still your body to complete motionlessness to hear the ocean waves hitting the beach in the distance, but once you did they were always present.\nAnd that was my answer. It turns out that when I quiet my rational mind there are other sources of knowledge available to me. My mind had been so loudly talking to me that I could not hear the ocean. My rational mind might have an answer for just about everything, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that what it has to say is terribly useful. In mathematics it is possible to arrange mathematical symbols so that they fit the syntactic rules, but what they represent are meaningless. In the same way it is possible to ask a number of questions that seem to make sense, but are meaningless, really, if you try to answer them rationally. Questions like \u0026ldquo;Should I commit suicide?” or \u0026ldquo;What is the meaning of life?\u0026rdquo; only have truly satisfying answers if you quiet your mind down enough to hear the actual answers. But I did not yet have access to those other answers. That took some work. It was a good start, though. I at least now was open to hearing other answers, and I started to pay closer attention to the states my mind went to.\nHe thought up the Matrix first Renegade mathematician "

	"content": "I talked about taking care our bodies. Let’s now go deeper and talk about what happens when we have trauma. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. When Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score, first started out as a psychiatrist his profession didn\u0026rsquo;t have much to offer traumatized people. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even really recognize PTSD as a thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he describes the many, many different, promising therapy options for trauma we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop the cycle of one generation passing it\u0026rsquo;s trauma on to the next. And as different as all these therapy options are they do share two thing \u0026ndash; first, they help people connect their bodies back into the world, and second, they do it with the help of others.\nI worked with a very, very traumatized young woman struggling to recover from extreme childhood PTSD. When she told me her history I would weep with horror \u0026ndash; it was just too much. How could anyone possibly recover from that!? She suspected her crippling illnesses were all that trauma still living on inside her body. We used MDMA as sacred medicine and she had an amazingly rich journey. She discovered a nurturing, holy connection with her body and her face glowed with joy. Up until then her body had only been a source of pain, something she had to learn to manage and hold off. Her body never had enough heat and was always cold. Now she had plenty of heat. For over a year after that journey our Hakomi sessions had her finding her way back to her body. Simply remembering her sacred journey was all that it usually took. It profoundly changed her life. She still had her medical challenges, but now she was able to step into the world in a much bigger way. It starts with the body.\nAnd then there is sex. Our society does not handle sex very well. Most of us have unprocessed sexual shame. We have a lot of healing to do here \u0026ndash; sex is yet another way we are disconnected from our bodies. But sex is so fundamental. We can not get to the world we want without reclaiming the sacred nature of sex. Because we have such a weird energy around sex it blocks intimacy with others. It holds us back from something as simple and basic as touch \u0026ndash; something all humans need and yet we are starving ourselves for it. In my first HAI workshop I found myself naked, straddled with another naked man, and stroking his face with deep love. It was very hard. I had never done that with a man before. It was so clear to me that this was not sexual, but it was so intimate. I had never been so intimate with someone without it leading to sex. And I had a big aha! moment \u0026ndash; sex and intimacy are different. Maybe I sort of understood that in my head, but now I finally got it all the way. Got that deep down I had thought that the only way I could have true intimacy was sex. What a limiting story that was! It meant that the only possible source of intimacy I could have was with my wife when we were having sex. No wonder I was so desperate for sex! Yes, I had a strong sex drive but what was really driving me was my desperate need for intimacy. And our sex life was not working \u0026ndash; that hurt so bad and I was angry about it. When I got home from the workshop a miracle occurred. In one wild moment I was able to let go all of that anger and hurt. Suddenly I understood that having sex didn\u0026rsquo;t mean my wife didn\u0026rsquo;t love me. I knew that she did. Sex and intimacy are related but different.\nPeople need to feel strong in their bodies before they can do the bigger healing work. The new culture we create has to start with this. An important part of this is healing our relationship with food and drink. We need to help people find a way to eat and drink in a way that best supports them. Have them really pay attention to what happens when they eat or drink something. For example I was in denial about my developing pre-diabetes until one day I took my son and his girlfriend out to a Thai restaurant. When we came back to his dorm room I had to crash on the couch \u0026ndash; I was in a food coma. He started talking to his girlfriend as if I were not there saying \u0026ldquo;This is not right\u0026rdquo;, and there I was feebly thinking \u0026ldquo;I am still right here you know!\u0026rdquo; but not having the energy to say it out loud. It turns out that my body can no longer properly do the whole insulin thing that happens when you eat sugar. I do much, much better when I eat low carb. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t have it as bad as I do, but many people would find they feel much better if they cut back on their sugar/carb consumption.\nAnd our bodies need to move. The health benefits of even mild exercise are very well documented. And yet many of us don\u0026rsquo;t exercise enough. Why is that? It is because exercise is treated like an extra thing to be tacked on to an already busy schedule. The trick is to weave it into our lives. For most of my working life I made sure that biking was part of my daily commute. And at work I always took the stairs instead of the elevator. Simple but very effective. No willpower needed to do exercise it was just part of my daily routine. We do so much better when we feel physically strong. I started weight lifting at a gym and noticed how much stronger it made me feel mentally. I struggle sometimes with depression, and I notice that if I can just manage to go on a short run that I find energy to do other things and it starts a virtuous cycle that pulls me out of that depression.\nBut sometimes we need to listen to that depression \u0026ndash; it is trying to tell us something is off. I went through years of depression before finding out that it was partly because my testosterone levels had plummeted way below normal levels. The first day my testosterone was back up to normal level I had so much more energy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it. Why hadn\u0026rsquo;t I gone to a doctor earlier? I had just assumed it was all in my head but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nAll of this is pretty obvious. We know all of this already. But what we are not doing is bringing all of this together. Instead we hold all of these things separate. Therapy is kept strictly separate from nutritional counseling is kept strictly separate from body work. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. The new culture we create has to bring the body in as the place we start from. Where are you with your body? How are you treating it? Where do you feel shame about your body? Are you regularly moving your body? Are you in touch with your true sexual nature? Are you getting enough touch? Before we heal the world we have to heal ourselves. And a big part of that healing is healing our relationship with our body.\nOnce we feel safe enough we can find our truth by noticing in exquisite detail what is going on in our body from moment to moment. Huh. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling sad. Where is that showing up in my body? Maybe my chest? Maybe my throat? Our emotions always live somewhere in our body we just need to notice where. Let\u0026rsquo;s just sit and breathe with that for a moment. And then we get curious \u0026ndash; what wants to happen next? There is an incredible wisdom to listening to that. That brings us back to Organicity.\n"

	"content": "Each stage brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarly Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings. And that gift is crucial. This is too big a project to spurn any help \u0026ndash; we need all the gifts.\nBeige If you read other writer\u0026rsquo;s descriptions of Beige you will find them dismissing this stage as impossibly primitive and best quickly skipped over. They are making a huge mistake. For most of us this is going to be the most important stage. Healing has to start here.\nImagine you have been hiking mostly alone in the wilderness for months. You are carrying a heavy pack and it hurts. You have lost most of your toenails. And yet day in and day out you keep on going. Why? Because you have a desperate need for healing. A healing that only nature can provide. And day by day you start to find yourself. This is where it has to start. Nature helps us find our feet. Cheryl Strayed tells an inspirational story of healing herself by hiking 1100 miles of the PCT in her book Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. This clip is the final scene from the movie adaptation. I think people find her memoir so compelling because on some level they recognize the healing power of simply walking in nature.\nWild Ending Scene\nI am going to come back to this stage over and over. It is the base everything else is built on.\nGifts Profound connection with nature Right diet (eating what works best for your particular body) Exercise Sexual vibrancy Touch Nurturing family Internal knowing Purple We have forgotten what Purple knows. It is now just too weird and harsh for most of us. Whether it is the Australian aboriginal Dreaming or a Lakota Eagle Dance where dancers pierce their chests with a rawhide thong so they can dangle from a pole that they spend days dancing around with no food or water, or the wild Spirit world of the Dagara people described by Malidoma Somé it is beyond our modern abilities to understand.\nSomé talks about this in his book, The Healing Wisdom of Africa. He was ripped away from his family in Africa at the age of 4 by missionaries and put in a missionary school. He escaped 16 years later only to find he could no longer even speak the language of his Dagara people. The elders decided he should undergo the dangerous, traditional initiation even though he was now much older than the typical initiate. At first he struggles. He is too western now he thinks. And this is just too hard and weird. Talk to a tree? Crazy. The heat is unbearable, ants are crawling over him, and he is almost at the point of giving up but he finds himself humbly talking to the tree. And a Green woman steps out to embrace and bless him. His life is changed forever. I read the story from his book here.\nPurple is where we ultimately need to return to. We will need to revive this ancient wisdom, but without rejecting all the other stages. As with Beige, the other stages tend to dismiss this stage as primitive. Again, they are missing something very important. Hopefully Turquoise will lead us back here.\nGifts Community Spirit of place Creativity Wisdom of tribe Red There is a part of us that wants to crush and dominate our enemies. I try to deny this, but it is there in me too. So much suffering has come from this stage, and yet it is a part of us. And we so desperately need it. We need Red to make our vision big enough. Where else are we going to get the courage to take on this crazy challenge? Other stages tend to think too small \u0026ndash; Red reminds us to really go for it. We can take the wild warrior spirit found in many young people (particularly young men) and use it to create a world-wide peace keeping force. Because make no mistake the world needs protecting. There will always be some would be dictator who wants to grab for power. It has been that way since the beginning of recorded (Red) history, it will not suddenly stop now. The trick will be to embrace this stage but not collapse into it. We will need to find the balance between deeply honoring the peace-keepers willing to sacrifice their lives, but not get caught up into war hysteria when war comes our way.\nJim Channon, a high stage officer in the U.S. Army had a vision of warrior monks who protect the world as it evolves to the next stage:\nFirst Earth Battalion\nHe wrote this in 1982 (during the Reagan presidency) so he was very much ahead of his time, but I think he was on to something. Many young people want to be warriors. Let\u0026rsquo;s put that to good use because we will need their protection. It will let people channel all that aggressiveness into something positive.\nGifts Guardian warriors Honor Commitment to excellence Drive to change the world Blue When Gandhi was asked what he thought about Western civilization, he (maybe apocryphally) responded, \u0026ldquo;It would be a very good idea\u0026rdquo;. He of course had a point, but the British empire should get some credit for not simply shooting him. Other rulers would not have hesitated. For example, when the older leaders in Guatemala were confronted with a U.S backed right wing coup they counseled the younger leaders to respond with non-violent protests. These older leaders were then all summarily executed by the dictators. The remaining younger leaders headed to the hills and a brutal, thirty year, genocidal civil war was launched. No one gained from this. England was operating from Blue, the Guatemalan right wing dictators were clearly in Red. We desperately need more Blue in this world.\nConsider the Mormons. Most people have a blindspot about this religion. For sure they are patriarchal and many but not all are deeply bigoted. I don\u0026rsquo;t condone that even a little, but they do have some things to teach us. They have part of the answer. Something they are doing is actually working. Mormons know that they are part of something much, much bigger than themselves. Mitt Romney said exactly that when he courageously cast the lone Republican vote for impeachment. That is the gift of Blue. There is something vibrant here. The focus turns away from just me and mine to community and service. We recognize we are part of a greater whole. Mormons support each other. Families work much better because they are supported by a vibrant community. Children are raised with a sense of purpose and belonging. Most Americans have lost the skill of getting along with their neighbors. Most Americans don\u0026rsquo;t even know who their neighbors are! But many Mormons do. Utah (the home of the Mormon church) calls itself the Beehive state to symbolize this sense of togetherness. Salt Lake City is one of the most vibrant cities in the country.\nWe have had a disastrous collapse of Blue in America. In The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again, Robert Putnam describes how America back in the 1870\u0026rsquo;s started to find its way to community after the horrible strife of the Civil War. Women organized to get the right to vote, workers endured getting shot to unionize, and wealth became more evenly divided. We forget how before this seniors quite often died in miserable poverty. We forget how children before this died from eating tainted food. We forget how workers died fighting to give us the 40 hour work week. Even Blacks, although still treated horribly at least gained some increase in prosperity. People felt a call to be of service to their community. This all started to collapse in the 70\u0026rsquo;s. Income inequality is now higher than it has ever been, and in the 2020 election the Republican party formally voted to overthrow the election. We have not been this divided since the Civil War. We don\u0026rsquo;t want the sexism and racism that typically comes with Blue, but we desperately need that sense of community again. We need this gift.\nGifts Truth bigger than just yourself Sacrifice for the common good Cohesive society Mutual support Orange When my son was in fifth grade, I came to his class every week for a while and taught the kids how to make a little turtle on the screen do things. I told the kids things like, try making the turtle draw a triangle, great now how about a square?, great now how about a pentagon?, and kept on having them add sides until they eventually created a circle. The kids loved it so much that one week they asked \u0026ldquo;Mr. Levy why are we getting to do this?\u0026rdquo;. They thought they were just playing games at school. I replied \u0026ldquo;This is math\u0026rdquo; and they recoiled back in shock and horror. One of the stronger programmers started talking to herself out loud, \u0026ldquo;Math? I can\u0026rsquo;t do math\u0026rdquo;. For a horrible moment it looked like it could tip towards the kids giving up. That girl went helpless. Fortunately, the fun proved to be too enticing and they were able to go back to enjoying themselves. They learned solid math that typically is not covered until high school (xy coordinate system, conservation of angles, functions, etc.) but they didn\u0026rsquo;t even really think of it as a class. At the end I asked who realized now that math can be fun and creative. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s hand shot up.\nScience is amazing. Math is incredibly beautiful and powerful. There is a deep refuge in logical thought. But most people don\u0026rsquo;t know this. When I get lost in my programming it feels like I am strolling through serene, crystalline groves. It is an incredibly soothing sanctuary. We have always been natural scientists, but what this stage brings is the discipline and rigor of math and logic. We need this stage too. We need to trust that numbers are real. Most anti-vaxers don\u0026rsquo;t really believe in numbers, because it is too abstract. They didn\u0026rsquo;t believe there was a spike in cases because they were not personally affected. And here is the funny thing \u0026ndash; numbers kind of aren\u0026rsquo;t real. They are this abstract idea. It is a leap of faith to trust that this abstract stage is \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo;. People don\u0026rsquo;t just naturally get there, they usually have to be taught. And we are not doing such a great job of teaching kids this. Math and science are usually presented as yet another burden to bear instead of an incredible gift.\nWe can not solve some of our most urgent problems unless and until we convince people that numbers are real. The numbers around Covid hospitalizations for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated are real. The numbers describing the coming climate catastrophe are real. The numbers supporting the analysis of systemic racism are real. The numbers of women reporting sexual harassment and abuse are real. But simply reciting the facts to an anti-vaxxer won\u0026rsquo;t help. Unless and until we can get them to where they truly believe numbers are real you can recite all the facts you like they simply will find the one anecdote that supports their preferred belief.\nPeople are flooded with so many different \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; opinions. How do we really know that the 2020 elections were not stolen? How do we know that global warming is not just a hoax cooked up by the Chinese? How do we know that vaccinations are statistically safe? Unless and until people have a firm grounding in critical thinking and the scientific method they are at the mercy of every stray internet posting. And again we teach kids science as if it is a collection of facts to remember instead of a world view to cultivate. Until we get more people to open up their math/science minds we will not be able to convince them of how urgently we need change. We desperately need more people at this stage. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be so hard. We don\u0026rsquo;t need people to understand calculus to get here. We just need them to find their math brains. We all have one! We would not be able to talk otherwise \u0026ndash; grammar is very mathematical. When I helped my daughter with math, my biggest challenge was to get her to believe in herself. To get her to recognize that yes she too has a math brain. And when we finally got there she was surprised to find out how good at math she really is. We all have this math/science capability. And even if some people are more drawn to this realm than others, it is part of all of us. We need to teach people to love and honor this vital part of themselves.\nGifts Math/Science Predict the future Engineer mindset Accountability Green I believe we will heal this world one community at at time. For many years I lived in Cohousing which is a kind of intentional neighborhood. It has a little bit of the vibe of a commune, but everyone owns their own homes with mostly normal bank loans. People choose to live there because they want to live in a community where everyone knows everyone else. It is basically just a return to how it used to be. And it can be very magical. When I moved into Winslow Cohousing on Bainbridge island my son was welcomed by the boys his age in the community and I watched him blossom. It turns out that sometimes peer pressure can be a very good thing. His new friends encouraged him to draw more, eat healthier, and connect more. Kids do better in a supportive, loving community. It is not natural or healthy to not know your neighbors. And Cohousing is very Green.\nCohousing is a bottom up, grass roots movement, so each forming community chooses how they organize. And pretty much all cohousing communities choose to do a very radical thing \u0026ndash; they choose to govern by consensus. That meant that on all important decisions every adult member of the community has to agree or at least not block consensus. Getting to consensus is actually even harder than it sounds. Typically a cohousing community has around 50-60 adults. I can not adequately describe to you the tedium and frustration of getting 55 adults to agree on what color to paint the exterior walls. Many cohousers got pretty frustrated with the process. Currently the movement is switching to Sociocracy which is a more sophisticated way to do consent decision making. But this frustration we felt does have some value. It teaches us how to listen to everyone. Listen even to those we disagree with. Because everyone\u0026rsquo;s voice is important and needed. And when people know that their viewpoint is going to be respected, not simply swept aside, their bellies unclench. Real communication happens when people are speaking from unclenched bellies. And from that more relaxed place, you suddenly can realize, \u0026ldquo;Huh. I guess they have a point. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought of it like that.\u0026rdquo;\nThis stage is where we realize that our \u0026ldquo;rationality\u0026rdquo; is mostly an illusion. It is mostly a social construct. This is where we start to realize that finding \u0026ldquo;Truth\u0026rdquo; is not nearly so simple as we thought. That there are many equally valid perspectives that all contradict each other, and yet each is True. This is where we recognize how much oppression and needless suffering there is in the world, and no longer accept this suffering as inevitable.\nGifts Egalitarian Post-rational Everyone matters Yellow (Second Tier) Finding our full Truth is scary. This path requires courage. If we have unprocessed trauma we need to first address it in our Healing Up work. If the trauma is too raw there is too much pain to do much else so this has to be handled first. We need to learn to deeply love ourselves despite all our imperfections. That creates the safety needed to go even deeper. To find out more of our Truth. What is holding us back is that certain things are too dangerous to know. It would hurt too much to know. So our protector parts conspire to hide us from our full truth. Those parts are working hard to protect us. So we can\u0026rsquo;t just jump straight all the way in. We have to take baby steps. Dip a little deeper into the Truth, pause to find compassion for ourselves and integrate this new understanding. And then keep on dipping a little further. At some point we realize that instead of looking for others to their Truth we now find it inside ourself. We now stand accountable to ourselves. Welcome to Yellow.\nThe fact that you have read this far means you are very likely at least an emerging Yellow. Until you get to Yellow people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be ready to even talk much about stages. There seems to be a blindspot. Earlier stages just assume everyone should be like them. For example, when I talk to someone at Green about people at Red, the person at Green usually can\u0026rsquo;t get past their anger. Why are they like that? Why can\u0026rsquo;t they simply see how wrong they are? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how smart you are (and there are incredibly smart people at Green), unless you have done some deep inner work you can\u0026rsquo;t see that we all have stages within. At Yellow you start to recognize this. Once you go looking, it is pretty easy to find Beige and Purple inside yourself because they are so delightful. Red I admit is harder for me. But I did some experimentation with BDSM and found my inner monster. Domination/Submission is electric for me. It actually scares me to admit how much of a wild monster I have inside myself. Notice how much inner work this required. At Yellow we find out how vast we are. We get better about not othering people. Not putting them into a collection of word boxes because no one fits neatly in a box. Yellow really gets that people are doing the best they can from moment to moment, and they are at wherever they are at.\nWhy is it so important to recognize this? First because it helps us live a much richer, meaningful life, but second because it makes us much more effective. If you simply keep on telling someone about global warming (or systemic racism, or sexism, etc.) and they are not at the stage where they can hear you, you are actually making the situation worse. You have to meet them where they are. I mentioned Rick Doblin earlier as an example. When he set out to legalize psychedelic assisted therapy he wisely focused on the benefits of MDMA for Iraq war veterans suffering PTSD. This allowed Red to come on board. He ignored LSD (even though it also could be a very useful medicine) so as to not antagonize Blue. He also made sure that all research went through standard channels which reassured Blue. And the research was meticulous and rigorous. That let Orange come on board. Green got excited about his bigger dreams to save the world \u0026ndash; which he was careful to not talk about too much so as to not alarm the other stages. This is Spiral wizardry. It is a clear example of how to get things done. We need more of this.\nGifts Recognize and welcome all the stages Able to get to the deeper Truths Internal strength Joy! Spiral wizardry Turqoise At this stage we will regain the freedoms that we lost when we lost Purple. We forget how much more freedom we had then. We could live anywhere we wanted. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have to obey a boss, and we could easily create our own \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo; if we wanted.\nThe gift of this stage is that after we find ourselves we then find each other. On our own it is so easy to stay in the trance of helplessness and hopelessness. As a group we will awaken to hope. This stage brings us all the way back home to where we started. With a deep, profound reverence for the land we walk on. And a celebration of community. It will be so much fun! There will be dancing and music, delight and spectacle. And while having that fun we will become bad-asses once more who change the world one community at a time.\nGifts World wide community Reverence for our planet Fun! True Freedom Bad asses who change the world "

	"content": "“Cleaning Up” is a good foundation to build on. But everything I talked about there is personal growth 101. We start there but by itself it is not enough. We now are going to step into some work that is harder..\n“Waking Up” combines the fierce ambition to conquer the world with the grace of surrendering to something bigger than ourselves. Think of Martin Luther King. He came from a place of righteous anger that would not be turned aside, but he led us to a place of much bigger love. That is what “Waking Up” brings to the world. We need more of this. So far not so bad, but it gets harder. I’m also going to ask you to embrace your inner asshole and encourage you to step out on to the skinniest branches of woo woo. Easy right?\nMost of us doing this work are coming from strong Green, and Green does not see eye to eye with MAGA seditionists and religious zealots. Nor should it. But it is important to not let that blind us to the gift these levels bring as well; the warrior and the mystic. We all have an inner warrior. We all have an inner mystic. Some people have an easy affinity with these archetypes. Not me — it took me quite a while to find my way to them. How about you? Stop here and check in with yourself. Where are you with your warrior? Where are you with your mystic? Are you aware of them? Are they places within yourself that you find easily or do you resist?\nSome (but maybe not many?) of you are naturally strong in one or both. If you grew up in strong Green I imagine it wasn’t easy for you. Green talks about anger as a “negative” emotion, and maybe our greatest fear is to be be an asshole. And a little bit of spirituality is ok, but please don’t embarrass us by getting way to woo woo. If you are one of the people who had to hide an important part of yourself let me apologize on behalf of the rest of Green. The truth is we need you. This is where you get to lead. We need the wild warrior that is going to conquer the world. This world needs conquering. But of course we are not just conquering the world for the sake of conquering it. Blue supplies the reason why. Blue has a big enough love to provide the “why”.\nBut finding that “why” is not a reasonable, decorous process. Nor is it easy. We need to learn to love those MAGA seditionists and religious zealots. In fact we especially need to love them. How are we going to do that? We embrace them as our mirror. Mirror?!? How could that possibly be?! I get it, it sounds impossible right? Please just stay curious for now.\n"

	"content": "Coming home on the bus from the “Wall” workshop I thought we were all done with our growth work; time to go back to the normal world. But not everyone felt like that apparently. A middle aged woman on the bus was still working through something. She asked one of the young men to role play her estranged son. They did a perfect job. I sat and watched from one seat back with folded arms feeling very superior to the woman. It was so obvious she was stuck in not forgiving herself. Then like a thunderbolt it hit me that she was doing my work. I also was not forgiving myself and it was causing me a lot of pain.\nBut it was kind of weird. The workshop was officially over and there was no facilitator on the bus to guide us and yet we were doing major work anyways. And then a second thunderbolt hit me — it is not just at workshops were we grow. Life itself is constantly our teacher if only we pay attention. In almost any situation, particularly difficult situations, there is an opportunity to learn and grow. When you wake up to that you have a personal growth mindset. Everything challenging and hard is an opportunity to grow. Personal growth people laugh about this and call it AFGO (Another fine growth opportunity). Sometimes we are known to use earthier language than fine.\nBut here is the key thing — my biggest growth has always been when I am in a community. We need to do our individual healing work, but we also so need to do our work together as well. In this section we spiral up and back to community (tock). For deep trauma work it is best to start off with nature, body work, and individual therapy (Beige). And that works needs to keep on going. But as soon as we have enough of a handle on our pain, it is time to do our work in group as well. That is where we expand beyond just healing our pain into leading a deep, rich, fulfilling life. Especially in our broken culture we need the help of a group to do our work.\n"

	"content": "I suggest we run this site the way open source projects usually are run. Programmers kind of just know how it works but let me try and make the underlying principles clear here. The goal is to come up with guidelines that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these guidelines please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.\nSimplicity I deeply value your time. I promise not to waste it. There is a lot to cover here, but I will only bring in the most important points. There are lots of fun tangents that can be visited as side topics, but the goal is to focus on finding the simplest thing that can work. Every idea will be expressed as simply and clearly as possible. If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand a concept it is my fault not yours. Let me know. If you think I\u0026rsquo;m wasting time on something, then you might have found an important bug (or at the very least I am not explaining well enough why it is essential).\nPractical The goal is to create something practical. Something that can actually change the world. Getting the theory right is incredibly important, but on the main path we don\u0026rsquo;t want to bring in any more theory than is strictly necessary. People like me can go off and do the readings, but then we need to come back here ready to share the useful nuggets that can be put to work.\nWe will know this project is working when we see it inspire actual healing and growth in the world.\nKaizen Kaizen means constant on-going improvement. It is always possible to grow and learn. You should be a bit skeptical of initial versions of this site, but over time as more people contribute and comment the site will grow and mature. Kaizen is a very open source concept. It is also very Japanese. You are never done with the work \u0026ndash; there is always more to be done. And there is a deep joy in that.\nSelf evident Nothing written here is meant to be taken on faith. Please find the truth of everything within yourself. The request, though, is that you search for this truth in all of yourself. Some people tend to only look for truth in their heads, others only tend to look for it in their hearts or spirit. The request is that you look for truth in all parts of yourself, especially in the parts that maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t typically search. This is especially true for spirituality. Any claim made here is meant to be validated by your own internal experiments. It has to be that way. Only you can find the truth for yourself.\nOpen to feedback Open source has shown that collaboration works best when people are able to listen to feedback without letting their ego get too much in the way. Any organization that we create needs to have this as a guiding principle. This can be one of the hardest things to achieve, but it is one of the more important.\nAgain, the willingness to admit that we are wrong is key here. It is especially important when trying to create something new like this because we will have to change our minds numerous times as we try to figure this all out.\nNext steps OK, with that out of the way let\u0026rsquo;s get started. In the next section I\u0026rsquo;m going to give an overview of the plan, and then after that it\u0026rsquo;s time to finally dive in.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Orange StriveDrive Capitalism, Democracy, and Science Give me liberty or give me death The Japanese were confronting the technological results of The Age of Enlightenment. This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America\u0026rsquo;s Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:\n\u0026ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u0026rdquo;\nSelf-evident means that when you introspect on it, it becomes clear that it is true. Math proofs are meant to be self-evident. This was the age of Reason. Notice how this puts the source of Truth back in the individual. The purpose of life is now not focused on God but instead the pursuit of happiness. And we need our liberty (freedom) to go and do that. Both free market capitalism and democracy trust the wisdom of the crowd to get us to the best answers. This was a very radical idea at the time, and yet it has worked out surprisingly well. Markets do seem to be a much better mechanism than command economies and democracy is a much better governing system than all the alternatives.\nSo when those American Black ships steamed into Tokyo, Japan was faced with a stark choice. Stay Blue and inevitably become some western (Orange) country\u0026rsquo;s helpless colony, or make the switch to Orange. Japan chose to make the switch. This was a remarkable period of time called the Meiji era. Japan is the only non-western country that made this leap during this time. It was maybe a century behind technologically, but because of all those years of peace and prosperity it had a strong cohesive base to build on. Remember up till now almost no Japanese had ever left the country (or if they had, they were not allowed back under pain of death). So Japan sent out Samurai nobles to study what they could learn from the different western countries to find the best ideas and bring them home. Within twenty years Japan was making enormous strides towards becoming an economic powerhouse. Within forty years it became a constitutional democracy and became one of the \u0026ldquo;Great Powers\u0026rdquo;. Then, just like the other Great Powers it started to set up its very own colonies.\nWhich is exactly the problem when people only focus on themselves \u0026ndash; it can cause a lot of suffering. Japan avoided becoming colonized but went on to become a colonizer itself. That seems to be where Orange ultimately takes us. The core irony of America is that the phrase \u0026ldquo;All men are created equal\u0026rdquo; was written by a slave owner who was forcing his underage slave girls to have sex with him. Yuck. Maybe just maybe, all those appeals to Reason weren\u0026rsquo;t as fair and impartial as they claimed. And what about all those people who were not white and male? What about their freedom and pursuit of happiness?\n"

	"content": "Before finishing this section I want to share some history resources. Although Spiral Dynamics is a story, there is real historical context to all of these stages. I hope I have inspired interest in this story of where we came from. If you are at all interested in learning more about any of the stages I strongly urge you to dig in and learn its history first. I am a book person so my recommendations are all books, but I know not everyone is so if you know of a good documentary or movie please send it to me so I can include it here.\nBeige Desmond Morris had a big influence on me when I was young. He really opened my eyes to how we are all still very much animals, and how we mostly are in denial about that. And of course our species is struggling — we are not at all adapted to the world we now find ourselves in. The Human Zoo: A Zoologist\u0026rsquo;s Classic Study of the Urban Animal was written in 1969, but it is still in print today because the message is still just as relevant. Desmond Morris noticed how animals in zoos suffered the exact same anxieties and neuroses that humans do. We have created our own human zoo to live in.\nPurple The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity astonished me from the very first page. It turns out Native American (Purple) intellectuals had a much bigger effect on the Age of Enlightenment than I realized. In this book an anthropologist and archaeologist team up to do the careful, painstaking scholarship needed to completely upend the existing myths about early societies. It turns out that Purple societies lived in large egalitarian cities for thousands of years. They used clever, sustainable agriculture that did not require excessive amounts of labor. And they knew all about Red, and consciously chose systems of government to prevent the empire of Red from arising. They had learned from hard experience what was necessary to lead free and full lives. This is such a great, foundational book. If you have time for only one book from this list, please consider choosing this one. They dispel the lingering myths and prejudices against the Purple age and show how much we still have to learn from it.\nOne important nuance that they bring up is that we did not just jump straight from one Purple to Red. There were steps along the way. It turns out that is true of all the stage changes. In the case of Purple to Red (they don’t use that terminology) there were three freedoms that were lost:\nfreedom of movement freedom to disobey freedom to create or transform social relationships They discuss various empires and show how these societies varied in how many of the freedoms above were lost. Only when all three freedoms are lost are you fully launched into the full on empire of Red. Red Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World This is such an interesting story all on its own. Genghis Khan overcame incredible adversity and then ended up conquering most of the known world quite late in life. I think he is more appealing than other famous conquerors because of the stages of freedom only freedom to disobey was lost. People, for example, still could move as they wished and practice religion as they pleased. This book also describes the remarkable story of how Genghis Khan’s son, Ögedei, had to embrace Blue before he could finish conquering China. But even then he kept a forbidden city in the center of Beijing where the Mongol rulers could retreat to their nomad tents and keep the illusion of still living on the plains.\nBlue Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes\nThis was such a delight to read. I was shocked to find how ignorant and prejudiced I am against the Muslim world. This book helped remedy that a little. It tells the story of a religious awakening that made the world a better place. I guess it is a similar story in some ways to how Christianity first arose but because it happened much later the story is much better documented.\nUpswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again\nAs we recovered from the civil war, earlier generations made taming Red their main focus, and they made huge progress. They built a solid Blue that gave Red something worthwhile to transition to. We built a society of associations and political movements. Labor unions were formed and bitter, lethal battles were fought for basic labor rights. Woman gained the right to vote. Unfortunately we have mostly let that Blue collapse and now we are going to have to rebuild. Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe the Blue of old with all its patriarchy and racism needed to die so we can recreate something better. But again we have some serious work to do. We have forgotten how to live together in community. We need to get kids out into nature together and aspiring to something higher. Grown ups need to belong to organizations that encourage everyone to take a turn at leading. And ultimately we want people joining groups that are dedicated to saving the world. This book chronicles how we did it once before.\nOrange A History of Modern Japan; In Search of a Nation: 1850 to the Present\nAlthough the Age of Enlightenment started in the West it did not stay there. Japan was the first non-western country to jump up to great power status. It is such a fascinating story of how they did it. This book shows how they consciously chose things to pull in from the West, but also how they consciously chose to also remain very Japanese. In the same way that there are steps along the way to Red, it looks like there are probably steps toward Orange. Japan’s culture was (is?) based on Neo-Confucianism which is very centered on rationality. So Japan’s leap to full Orange was not quite as big a leap as it might first appear. And we see that the other countries based on Neo-Confucianism (Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, China) have also made the leap to full industrial economies. This is probably not a coincidence.\nGreen A People’s History of the United States: 1492 - Present\nThe key thing that seems to keep people from becoming “woke” to Green is how they view history. It currently is literally illegal in many U.S. states to teach the full history of slavery in school. Books are banned and thoughts are controlled. Howard Zinn’s book was such a beautiful revolution when it first came out. He brought up all the awkward and deeply distressing stories of our history. Without knowing them we can not step into the full truth of who we are. This is such an important battle. Unfortunately we are still fighting it — the right to read his book is imperiled.\nBody-Centered Psychotherapy: The Hakomi Method: The Integrated Use of Mindfulness, Nonviolence, and the Body\nRon Kurtz helped create a new school of therapy called Hakomi. It was in reaction to the overly rational Orange schools of therapy prevalent at the time. I strongly recommend reading the whole book but it is at the beginning of the book where Ron lays out the basic principles. I have not seen a better Green manifesto than this. He recognizes the importance of rationality but then goes on to show that all by itself it is not enough for healing. He brings in a more ecological, wholistic way to look at the world.\nYellow How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence\nIn the beginning of his book Michael Pollan dives into the history of psychedelic therapy work. It is the best history of that time that I know of. Then he goes on to chronicle what it is like to do a guided journey. This book has launched a huge wave of interest in psychedelics.\nTurquoise We don’t yet have Turquoise history — it is something we are going to have to create together.\nI am privileged to know a lot of Yellow stage people. They are all amazing and making the world a better place. The problem is they have done such a good job of grounding in their inner Truth that they lose touch with the need for groups. In moving away from Green we learned to reject group think and instead learned to find the answers within. This is so important and necessary. And we need many more people at this Yellow stage. Yet even this stage is not enough. We need something even bigger. When I try to talk about saving the world to Yellow people they tend to focus on what impact they personally can make. And that part is super important \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t get there without all of these wise, individual contributions. But by itself it is not enough. Once we find that strength within we also need to see how we fit into the bigger picture. We need to once again come back to the group\n"

	"content": "In my thirties I ended up in a lot of pain. I longed for a release from this pain, and on a subconscious level suicide might even have been starting to look attractive. At least it all would be over then. I tried talk therapy, but was deeply unimpressed with that method, although it seems to have worked for others. Then I stumbled onto some mildly radical personal growth seminars. I absolutely loved them. It turned out that I had some work to do - my mental machinery needed some fixing. The classes revealed to me how much I feared others. I had on a deep level just assumed everyone was out to hurt me. So I experimented with giving myself permission to connect to others on a deeper level and found pure joy! I also found out that many people\u0026rsquo;s struggles were in fact mine as well. And then I started on the hard work of changing the beliefs and assumptions that were getting in the way. I gradually became aware of a voice that was constantly tearing me down and even punishing me. I battled to love myself instead of hate myself. One practice I used was to look in the mirror at my acne-scarred face and say from the heart, \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo;. To this day, every time I have a painful, negative thought about myself I habitually remind myself, \u0026ldquo;I have value\u0026rdquo;, and touch my hand to my heart. This may not sound like much, but it has been of enormous help to me. An acquaintance that knew me both before and after I had done this work said that, \u0026ldquo;You look a lot more comfortable in your skin now\u0026rdquo; - that describes it nicely.\nThe work of mental healing was fascinating, and I delved even deeper into it. The more I explored the more I came to realize that the very heart of healing is centered on spirituality. Even worse, I started to recognize and cherish my spiritual self. Oops. As a devout atheist (of course I was!), this was deeply surprising and not a little troubling. Note that I am not talking about \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;, which is something I still do not believe at least not in the traditional way, but instead I was discovering inside myself and others an unexpectedly powerful human mystery. After much thought and discussion, I realized that I was spiritual but not religious - there is a big difference. Spirituality, in my definition, is about experiencing the underlying truth, while religion is about the forms and rituals that are supposed to help you get to that truth.\nThere are many paths to the same goal, and no religion has the exclusive answer \u0026ndash; unfortunately many religions are confused about that point. Most religions seem to have forgotten their original purpose of helping people discover and cherish their spiritual natures, and instead have been corrupted into little more than a means of control. Note that the personal growth courses themselves made no overt or even implicit reference to spirituality - if they had they would probably have lost a lot of customers including, at least initially, me. But what I started to notice was that when the courses were working best they were evoking what I call spirituality. Spirituality, for me, is the strength I find inside myself to forgive; both others and myself. It helps me to discover what is truly important and lets me feel deeply connected.\nIf you are a true rationalist, I imagine you are deeply skeptical about all of this. A lot of religious talk seems like complete nonsense (or worse) to me too. How can I trust any system of thought that shouts my group is right and everyone else is so wrong that they are going to suffer eternal torture? My first strong reaction to this kind of craziness was to discount religions altogether as obviously false. And yet, most of the human race is religious (and presumably spiritual). Are all those people really just incredibly superstitious and ignorant? Many rationalists actually believe this, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;ve deeply thought about the matter - it is a case were arrogance gets in the way of discovering the truth. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it just possible that all of these religions are tapping into something shared by us all? Perhaps the message is getting badly distorted and misused, but isn\u0026rsquo;t it possible there is an important shared, core experience that all of these religions are tapping into? I became very curious about this possibility, but in order to discover this shared truth I had to do the work myself - much like working through a math proof.\nBack when I was at the University of Chicago I took a Physics class with a bunch of cutthroat pre-meds. The competition for getting a good grade was pretty intense, but I had a different goal. So much of my own painfully gotten money was on the line that I was determined to actually learn something. On the tests we were expected to have memorized a number of equations. This really bothered me because I knew that we would all quickly just forget the equations and therefore really learn nothing. This was presumably just fine with the pre-meds, but it was not OK with me. I discovered that if I memorized just one of the equations I could derive the others. I\u0026rsquo;m not even close to a mathematical genius, but I can be stubborn. So on each question of the test I would flip the test page over and start deriving the necessary equation and when I finally got it, I would flip the page back over, copy the derived equation and start doing the problem. As you can imagine this was a somewhat slow process, and invariably I only had time to do about half of the test, but I usually did well enough on just the first part of the test that usually I would get a \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;.\nDiscovering spirituality was a similar process for me. Rather than just taking the established spiritual \u0026ldquo;proofs\u0026rdquo; on faith, starting on first principles, I stubbornly worked them through for myself. For example, I learned that sexuality has three levels: body, heart, and spirit. Through painful trial and error I learned that the reason many religions get so worked up about sexuality is that on a spiritual level sex is very powerful and really should not be toyed with. The original messengers quite likely were just trying to emphasize the spiritual potency of sex and hoping to keep people from hurting themselves. I think that in most cases that message has gotten seriously garbled. The problem with working out all of this on my own was that it was hard, time consuming, and at times painful. And in the end I just rediscovered things that spiritual leaders have been saying all along. But it was worth it because it was my first concrete experience in listening to a source of knowledge outside of my rationality. I found that there really is something to what those spiritual people are saying. But, again, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to take this on faith - this is something you can prove to yourself by doing the work on your own.\nA good scientist is supposed to follow the truth no matter where it takes them. Sometimes the pursuit of truth can take them to places that completely upset the current paradigm and yet the scientist is expected to keep on going no matter what. I believe this. Follow the truth no matter where it leads. In my case, it has taken me to states of consciousness that I never would have guessed at\nThis book was very important to me "

	"content": "Change is messy and scary so we resist with all our might. But it is what we have to do. We can stay blocked for years and years, but organicity is always striving towards health and eventually something has to give. Let me give an example.\nI was in Guatemala with my (now) ex-wife and daughter for a month, and while we there my testosterone prescription ran out. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get a refill but it turns out that Guatemalan pharmacies will sell you pretty much anything they have without the need for a prescription. And they had this high quality testosterone made in Switzerland. Apparently you did just one injection and then you were good for a couple of months. That sounded pretty good \u0026ndash; the daily cream application was a hassle. So I had my ex inject me one night and we went to bed. I woke up in the early hours of the morning and I knew everything had to change. Everything. My ex suffered from extreme anxiety and she constantly was hit with crippling migraines that would keep her in bed for days. She felt a desperate need to control the world because it felt like her very survival was at stake. We had fallen into a bad pattern where she pretty much controlled everything about our lives. Even in the bedroom she would control moment to moment what happened during the infrequent times we were sexual. I went along with all this because I loved her and wanted to help, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work for either of us.\nI got up and took a long walk. I passed through the early morning markets the Guatemalans have way before they set up for the tourists and all the while I had this strong knowing that everything had to change. What that meant was I stopped letting my ex control everything. That led to a lot of heated arguments. If I had to do it again I would find a gentler way. From her perspective I became a different person over night. It is true I was on way too high a dose of testosterone and that was not good. But what it did was help push me past where I was so blocked. What we had been doing was so not working for me. Miraculously all that heat sparked something in us and suddenly we were having frequent, hot sex. It turns out that a certain polarity of dominance and submission can really give a sexual charge. At least in the bedroom I learned to embrace my strong masculinity. Unfortunately I fairly quickly collapsed into old, unhealthy patterns and that charge went away, but even still our sex was much better. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the sex that was the problem with our marriage, though, we were deeply enmeshed in old patterns and we both were very, very stuck. Her inner child was looking for someone to take care of her, and mine was so hungry for reassurance that I was attractive that I was looking to have an affair.\nLater on my ex worked with a powerful shaman woman in Guatemala and then with one in Mexico. These were non medicine trips but they were intense, life changing trips nevertheless. Midway through the second ritual she tearfully called me to say we needed to separate. That she still loved me with all her heart but that she needed to find a way to get out of this pattern of always needing a man. She needed to find her own way. I was stunned, but within a day I went to joy. I was longing for this too. When I picked her up at the airport she was just glowing. Instead of going home we stayed at a hotel for a couple of nights and took lots of walks to talks about this new path we were on. We committed to stay connected as loving friends and that we would still be a family for our daughter. We kept that promise \u0026ndash; we do much better as friends. And our daughter no longer has to put up with constant anger and fights.\nSeparating was the best possible thing for both of us. She started a very serious spiritual practice. She faced all of her inner traumas one by one no matter hard and found her way through. It was brutal and she suffered but she found peace and grace on the other side. She is now a very different person. She still has migraines occasionally but it is now far less frequent and her overall health is so much better. She is so much happier now that at times she is almost luminous. It could not have happened if we had just continued as we were. As for me, I was released from my caretaker role and I soared upwards in joy. For the first couple of years I almost could not believe how much joy I was in. I found an amazing partner and I tell her everyday how grateful I am to have her with me. I have a lot to be grateful for.\nThe key thing is we stopped waiting for the other to change. We were going to a marriage counselor secretly hoping that the counselor would get the other to change and then everything would be OK. That does not work. It was always our own work to do. We were \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; because we were waiting for the other person change to make us happy. And it was messy. She needed to see who she was outside of relationship but that meant ending our marriage and she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to hurt me. I held her need as greater than mine and had lost my power. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work for either of us. I had been holding back so long that when the dam finally broke it was way too abrupt.\nOddly enough what helped us discover that we needed to separate was to first fall more deeply in love with each other. We tried doing a guided MDMA journey together. It was incredible. We got more done in 3 hours than we had been able to do in counseling in 3 years. In the same way MDMA helps people revisit trauma without the fear, we were able to get to those conversations that we had been too scared to have. And then we found out it was OK. She was able to let me know that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t so sure she wanted to be married and that was a kind of hard but ultimately ok with me.\nMy ex calling me from Mexico was a real act of courage. A step into that scary unknown where we don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what is going to happen next. And in fact we had a real reason to be scared \u0026ndash; divorces can be horribly messy and painful. But as scary as it was, it had to be done. We had to stop waiting for the other to change in order for us to be happy. We had to step out of our victim stories into a place of accountability. Let’s go there next.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Green HumanBond unions, environmentalism, feminism, racial justice, LGBTQ, et. al For my brothers and sisters The genius of Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s I have a dream speech is that it builds on the (Orange) words of the Declaration of Independence and brings us forward into a new stage, Green. Please watch it — it is better to view than read. He says:\n\u0026ldquo;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed - we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\n\u0026hellip;\nAnd when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\u0026rsquo;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: \u0026ldquo;Free at last! Free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\u0026rdquo;\nNotice how he brings us back together to our shared humanity. Our deeper freedom arises from coming together not splitting apart. This realization was the start of so many important awakenings. The environmental awakening. We commit to cherish, honor, and protect our mother earth. The feminist awakening. Time to stop oppressing women and break free of our sexist stereotypes and limits. The peace awakening. No more mindless wars. The race awakening. We recognize how deeply racist our society is and we commit to healing this broken mindset. Later on \u0026ndash; this one took much longer sadly \u0026ndash; we started to embrace the LGBTQ community and the full continuum of our sexuality.\nAt this stage we start to realize that the rational mind is not the only source of Truth. Just because the detached observer mode (Positivism) worked out well for physics does not mean it is suited to understanding all of human experience. There is so much more inside of us than just the rational observer. And it in fact turns out that all those objective truths we think we are working with are greatly influenced by out culture. Truth can not be considered to be wholly separate from the culture it is found in. This stage reminds us to look out to see all the groups we are bound to.\nI was born into this stage. My parents were liberal, college educated, school teachers who encouraged their children to care for this world. And Green explains a lot of things, except for the things I most needed to learn \u0026ndash; how do I get out of all this pain that I am in? What does it mean to lead a deep, rich, meaningful life? What does it mean to be fully human? For those questions I needed to turn within.\n"

	"content": "So how are we going to do this? What does the plan look like?\nThe Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can\u0026rsquo;t just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.\nIntegral Theory The first step is getting our stories straight. The stories we have been telling ourself up to now have not been serving us. They have been keeping us helpless and isolated. We need to find a bigger story that brings us together. A story that gives us solid ground to stand on. Fortunately, I think much of this work has already been done. Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Buddhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that it is a great foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.\nThis is his beautifully succinct summary of the work we all need to do:\nGrowing Up Cleaning Up Waking Up Showing Up I add on one more:\nWising Up Growing Up Before we can change the world we have to really understand and model the vastly different ways people look at the world. We are missing a map to help us chart our way. We need to go deeper than just assuming that everyone thinks about things pretty much like we do. They don\u0026rsquo;t. Not even close in fact. And yet some how, some way we need to convince people to open their hearts wider and wider. How do we do that? First we need to meet them right where they are and talk to them in a language that works for them. There is a theory called Spiral Dynamics that I think is perfect for this. I think it works best as a story of our history. It describes the major stages that humanity has already gone through and offers some predictions on what wants to happen next. Each stage described in Spiral Dynamics builds on the next. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to shift everyone, but we will need to shift as many people as we can before we can create the new culture that is needed.\nCleaning Up We start with our initial wounds as children and then over time we accumulate more and more junk inside of ours ourselves that hides us from our true nature. In Spirited Away there is a wonderful scene where an incredibly stinky spirit comes to the bathhouse for help. At first it looks hopeless. Why waste good medicinal water on something so dirty as that? But the heroine, Sen, bravely persists in trying to help. Then it becomes clear that there is something stuck to the spirit that doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong (it looks like a bicycle handle). The entire bathhouse community joins together to help pull this thing out. And as they pull more and more stuff keeps coming out. A lifetime accumulation of junk comes pouring out. Until there is just one more tug and a \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; and all we are left with is the spirit\u0026rsquo;s true, smiling nature. We all need to pull out this wounded junk of a lifetime to get back to our true, shining nature.\nTo get there, though, we have to do two things. First we have to heal (or at least address) our wounds. Then we need to learn a more skillful approach to life. These are very related practices but they require different approaches.\nWhen we are in pain all we can do is focus on simple survival. Nothing else matters. We have to step out of our pain before we can start thinking in a bigger way. The urgency of our traumas demand attention. This requires a very gentle, safe approach. A trauma informed therapist can be of real help here. They can help people find where the trauma still lives in them. Where it still in fact lives in their body and then help them find their path to healing. If the wounds are deep enough (eg. PTSD) MDMA assisted therapy might be called for.\nOnce we have done some of our healing work we next need to recognize that most of our suffering is completely unnecessary. We are caught up in trances and unskillful habits that do not serve us. If we adopt a personal growth mindset we can discover how much more joy we can live in. For example, Buddhists teach that if you are willing to do some very hard growth work there are incredible levels of joy you can get to. But Buddhism is not the only path. Integral theory brings in all the wisdom paths. We need to use these paths to teach the world how to step deeper into joy. Because it is when we are most in joy that we can most be in service.\nWaking Up The bathhouse clip above doesn\u0026rsquo;t show it, but what happens next after all the junk is removed is that the smiling spirit becomes a river dragon that roars up out of the bathhouse and blasts into the sky. We are all spiritual beings. After we have done our cleaning up this becomes achingly obvious, and then just like that river dragon we go roaring out into the sky. This is what we are meant to do, but unfortunately many of us have too much junk still attached to us. Also most of the organizations that claim to support spirituality are still in earlier developmental stages (growing up). Most religious organizations are not advanced enough to meet this moment.\nThe end goal, again, is to get people to open their hearts wider than they know is possible. Wide enough to encompass all that needs to be done. A reawakened spirituality can get us there. When we fully embrace our spirituality we know the other as us. There is no artificial separation between you and me. You are all my brothers and sisters and even closer. This is the teaching of both Buddha and Christ. It is, I believe, a fundamental ground of spirituality.\nShowing Up This is where we are take our place in the world. We are grounded in that sense of something bigger than ourself, but now it is time to make practical changes. The first step is to welcome our thinking mind. We very much need that part of us too. We need to come up with practical policies that might work. Things like universal basic income, and innovative economic incentives to encourage emissions reduction are so needed.\nBut this all has to be balanced with the recognition that our science brains can only get us so far. We have to make sure we are creating a just, sustainable world. We need to take into account things like how marginalized communities have always been the ones who bear the worst brunt of pollution. And we have a very long way to go before woman are not marginalized. The women of Iran are currently leading the way in how to Show Up.\nWising Up The dragon roaring into the air is the first step of wising up. At first we fly alone. But then we dance in the sky with others. We start by recognizing our own strength and beauty. And then we fall down in awe and wonder as we recognize the astonishing majesty of others. We start to see that we are all one. The beauty I see in you is my beauty. But in the same way your pain is mine as well. And oh my there is so much pain! Now that I realize your pain is mine, it is so clear that something needs to shift but what? I think Buddha was one of the very first to Wise Up. He taught us to first just recognize the pain, then step fully into the pain. And then finally we can awaken to something bigger.\nRecognize the Pain If you are at the point of feeling the world\u0026rsquo;s pain, congratulations. Most of us hide from it. It means that you have allowed yourself to open up to a bigger, wider Truth than most. This is where we have to start. Notice how upsetting all of this is. I personally struggle with this. As I enter my Grandfather stage of life, I am ashamed at how profoundly my generation has failed to provide a healthy, nurturing place for our grandchildren. This is so not OK with me. And again, I stop and breathe and let myself really recognize how much pain there is. It starts here.\nStep fully into the pain I start to breathe into the pain. Letting it be. I stop fighting it and I start to accept it. This is important. I need to pay attention to this. Once I get past the shock of it, I notice that pain always brings a gift with it \u0026ndash; the energy to change. We make our biggest shifts when we are in great pain. It takes something like that to make us leap to something new. If the right kind of support is there we can use this pain as a path of transformation. No guarantees on this one sadly, but there is a beauty and joy that can shine out through the cracks of the deepest suffering. And that light illuminates the path that we ultimately need to follow. The pain provides the energy and courage for us to start.\nAnd then I notice something different this time. As I sit with this immense, vast pain I realize that I am at least as big as this pain because I also am immense and vast. How can I not be? I am one with all. Time to own that. I no longer need to hide away \u0026ndash; I am big enough to contain all of this.\nAwaken to something bigger I then awaken to this vast, shared consciousness that is trying to figure out what wants to happen next. Part of us wants to go back to sleep and part of us wants to wake up. I am on the side of waking up. It is time. And as unworthy and yes, maybe even broken as I feel myself to be, I offer myself up in service to waking the world up. Not even sure if that is ultimately what wants to happen, but nevertheless knowing this is what I am called to do. I look inwards and see my suffering and then I look outwards to see the suffering of the world. I look inwards to see my joy and then I look outwards to see the joy and beauty of this amazing world. Breathing into myself and then out into the world and then breathing in again. Letting myself know that I am as big as all of this. This is my deeper work. This is my purpose.\nAnd then I circle back to where I started \u0026ndash; that childlike sense of awe and wonder. That knowing that the world can be very, very beautiful. But it takes a magic wish to start it all.\nReady to start this magic journey with me?\n"

	"content": "I’m afraid that by just reading this site you will get the impression that this personal growth stuff is all very serious, hard work that involves a lot of suffering. It can be that way, but it doesn’t have to be. If you find the right healing group this work actually becomes tremendous fun. Yes it is still very challenging, but it just feels right. You are not alone. Others are doing similar work as you and you are supporting each other every step of the way. There is a knowing within and a sense of flowing in the right direction. That is the heart of organicity. We learn to trust that our organism is always striving towards health. Always. We intuitively know what we need, we just need to get out of our own way to let it happen.\nThis work is best supported by groups, but Americans have gotten so hyper-individualized that they have forgotten how to be in a group. That is where Cohousing comes in. I watched one of the “burning souls” of the Cohousing movement give a speech once. He started off by asking some questions. “How many names of your the children in your neighborhood do you know? One? Two? Three? More than Three?” Some hands went up initially but quickly went down as the numbers went up. Next question. “If you needed to borrow a car how many neighbors could you borrow from? One? Two? Three? More than Three?” Even less hands this time. Next question. “If you needed a ride to the hospital is there a neighbor you could ask?” Even less this time. Then he continued. “Now I’m going to spend a little time talking today about a very radical experiment in housing. Don’t worry I will spend most of my time talking about the traditional Cohousing model where everyone knows their neighbor. But first let’s talk about this set up where everyone lives alone. This is a very new concept, and I’m not sure it is working out that well. I personally would not feel comfortable putting my kids in such an unusual experiment. I prefer to stick to the time tested ways of living like it always has been done!”. The audience laughed, but they got his point.\nIn Cohousing everyone still owns their own home, and they still get a bank loan to pay for their unit. What is different is the culture. We have forgotten how to live together. The thing is — we were meant to live together. It just feels much better. When I first moved into cohousing I had spent years working to build another cohousing development. So I knew in my head that this is what I wanted, but I confess I was still a little nervous. What surprised me is how strongly I felt it in my body after I moved in. It felt really good. My thirteen year old son who was only living with me part time felt it too. He has always had a strong bond with animals and he pointed out that “the cats feel like they belong here”. I was surprised at his reaction. For years he had watched me go off to endless cohousing meetings and he kind of thought of cohousing as some weird church that he wanted no part of. So first he sees the cats and then shortly after the neighbor kids meet him and warmly welcome him. And he was in.\nSometimes peer pressure works in a really good way. The cohousing kids had grown up in the community and you could tell that it had really worked from them. They all were doing really well and that helped my son who was struggling. He had grown up as an only child and all his Japanese friends kept on getting ripped away from him when their parents inevitably returned to Japan. He was lonely and now he was with friends. And they guided him in a good direction. One of his friends encouraged him to start a drawing journal and to draw every day — my son is a talented artist. Both my son and I had gotten into a bad habit of eating fast food. But now we were signed up for common meals. The community had frequent shared meals in the common house. The teens would sit off in the teen booth (a booth they had appropriated) when we ate. I remember watching with fascination as my son was first confronted with some weird goulash we were having. At first he tried to rally the others against this weird thing, but they all looked at him blankly as if to say, “Dude. It’s dinner.” They were used to eating whatever came their way. Within a year my son was, quite rightly, chastising me for my poor eating habits.\nThe thing to know is that this global healing and shift that I am calling for is the thing that wants to happen. We will know we are heading in the right direction when we feel the delight in our bodies. And just like my son getting guided by his peers and then turning around and guiding me we will have to do this together as a group. The key thing is to set things up so that the magic can naturally flow. People naturally want to be part of something bigger than themselves. Trust that. What doesn’t work is to stay in suffering and tell ourselves this is just the way it has to be. Tell ourselves that we are helpless and there really isn’t anything we can do. We get scared of change because as bad as things are now we (correctly) fear they can always become worse. We forget that the change that comes from organicity feels wonderful. Or maybe we never knew. Let’s go there next.\n"

	"content": "Again, organicity simply asks the question, “What wants to happen next?” and then the follow up question, “What is blocking that?”. Let me give you an example.\nI once did a series of three all day San Pedro (a type of cactus) medicine ceremonies. San Pedro is a very gentle hallucinogen that lasts for a very long time and you are fairly lucid most of that time. I did it with the same group each time, and the ceremonies were spaced roughly a month apart with a group meeting before and after each ceremony. We were asked to bring something to place on the altar for each session, something that would help guide us in out intentions. I didn’t know exactly why but something was telling me to bring this dragon that I had on my altar. I didn’t even know why I felt called to even put the dragon on my altar in the first place, but I am learning to follow my intuitions.\nThe day of the very first San Pedro ceremony, one of my fellow cohort — a man I love dearly — broke out into delighted laughter when he saw my dragon. He knew exactly what it meant and why I had brought it. But then he looked at my confused face and quickly sobered up. Clearly I didn’t yet get it, and this is something that can not be forced. This is the first part of organicity, it can’t be forced. And clearly I wasn’t ready quite ready. That first ceremony was lovely and powerful, but no insight about why the dragon was there came up. So when getting ready for the second ceremony a month later, I asked my altar who should come with me and it was so clear again that it had to be the dragon. Again I had no clue why. And when I got there it seemed like everyone else had already done their work with their previous altar object and now were moving on to something else. I felt a little shame that I was such a slow student. And again the second ceremony was sweet and as powerful as riding the ocean up and down all day. And yet again nothing came to me about my dragon. For the third session I seriously considered picking a different altar item just because now I was getting embarrassed. But if you can’t be full honest in sacred ceremony, what is the point? So I brought my dragon yet again. And this time, in the ceremony he spoke through me.\nIn the middle of this ceremony our guide did something different than the other times. This time instead of having us spend the whole time doing our individual work, he called us together in sacred circle to state our intent. Everyone took their turn. When it came to my turn, something blocked gave way in me. I am so, so angry at all the needless suffering in this world. All that needless suffering that has been, all the suffering going on right now, and all the suffering that I very much fear is coming. It is so not necessary! I’m angry at the people doing it and even more I’m so angry at myself for just standing by and not doing anything. Living in the comfortable trance that there is really not much I can do. What a comfortable lie. When I truly open to all that is it hurts! God damn it it hurts so much! So much I don’t know if I can bear it. Stop hurting people! Stop! Stop! I screamed and fell to the ground pounding my fists. And then finally got to deep, heartbroken sobs.\nTowards the end of the ceremony we were asked to state a prayer, and I named my anger as sacred and holy. It is something that was blocked, but no more. What needed to happen was for me to fully embrace how angry, upset, and hurt I am by what is happening in the world. And to have compassion towards myself for having done so very little to make things better, and god help me at times made things even worse. I will no longer use a victim trance as an excuse. What needs to happen is that I give voice to this bigger dream of a better world. A world that works for everyone, truly everyone not just some. That is why I’m doing this website. Every morning (that I’m not sick) I wake up and check in with myself. What is that I want very, very most? And every morning the answer is the same. I want this world to heal. Pain? Death? These are unavoidable. I accept that, but all this needless suffering? I’m am so, so not ok with it.\nAt the closing of that third ceremony, I told the group I wanted to introduce my dragon to them. He is kind of small and cute. He looks kind of gentle and playful. But he has a powerful fire burning within him. There is a power in me that just bursting to be released. This is my warrior — we all have one. I was scared of my warrior. Scared of the damage warriors can do. So I pulled back my power. And my fear is actually justified. When you step fully into your power, your bullshit becomes that much powerful too. This is what my cohort buddy was laughing at when he saw my dragon. It turns out that he also has a dragon within but it is very fierce and scary and so he too is afraid of letting it out. Seeing a cute, playful little dragon deeply amused him — he had never thought of his dragon like that. I will never be a macho, dominant, typical male leader (outside the bedroom that is). That is just not who I (normally) am. I tend to cry a lot in groups.\nAt the very end of the ceremony we are given the opportunity to do drawings to help integrate our experience. I found myself drawing a dragon’s breath and at the very hottest part of the breath is a glowing heart. I realized that this is what was missing. Now my dragon on the altar is sitting on top of that fierce flame drawing. This is where I was blocked. What wants to happen next is to release that breath out into the world. Anger is like a sword. It can be used to create great damage, or it can be used to protect. I choose to harness it’s potent energy to give me courage to stand for change. That is the organicity here. Now that I am unblocked, I am ready for the change that wants to happen. Time to go there.\n"

	"content": "Before I talked about Descartes\u0026rsquo; (and my) assumption that the rational mind is the center and everything else, including our bodies, revolves around it. I now believe just the opposite - it is our bodies that are the center and everything else, including our rational minds, revolves around the body. The proof for this statement is not in thinking about it rationally, but to instead introspect and remember the states that you have been to, and to at least be open to the possibility of finding other states. But what are these other states that I keep on talking about? Ultimately this is something that you will have to discover in yourself. Here are some of the states that I have directly experienced:\nRunner\u0026rsquo;s High I love to run. Our bodies love and need to work. When I run, I quickly slip into a semi-trance and my body just takes over. I typically have wonderful conversations with myself as I run - it is when I\u0026rsquo;m at my strongest. I make my most courageous decisions while I\u0026rsquo;m running - I feel powerful and capable. When I need to make a big decision, I like to go running on it. People who don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this state exists, or doubt that they can achieve it themselves are, by their very disbelief, keeping themselves from achieving this state. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that strange?.\nBerserker rage I discovered this state in high school football. I found that if I prepared myself mentally all of the day before a game I could go into a very, very powerful rage/trance during the game. This crazy rage made me a kind of star during my sophomore season. It turns out that we have a war-like, berserker state where we can do incredibly physical feats. The Vikings knew about these states - it is where we get the word \u0026ldquo;berserk\u0026rdquo;. The rage/trance let me perform way beyond my normal athletic limits. On the down side I also smashed through people without being conscious of what harm I was doing to them. From a rational point of view I can\u0026rsquo;t say much to defend this other than it is a lot more fun than you might think. To fully embrace being human we must accept that, on a very deep level, humans are unusually war-like animals.\nPersonal growth As I mentioned before, the more I worked towards healing my psychological wounds in my thirties, the more I discovered that just about all of this work revolves around spirituality. Another word for it, perhaps, is love, but it is a very powerful form of it. I know this is a difficult word for many, but it is the best that I can come up with for now. After taking a particularly powerful set of courses I remember just sitting in the Microsoft cafeteria and feeling unconditional love for everyone around me - regardless of how they might feel about me. Some of our best spiritual leaders talk about this state of consciousness; whatever word you choose our world could use more of this.\nCommunion with Nature The reason I love hiking and backpacking is that it puts me in closer connection with nature. Given a chance, I think all of us can feel this deep connection with the natural world. Environmentalist oppose the destruction of wilderness not just because of rational reasons, but because the land is sacred to them. Walk through a strand of old growth trees with a quiet mind, and I strongly suspect you might discover what I mean. There is a value to a tree far beyond its narrow economic value. There is a reason why even in the densest cities we find it imperative to mix in greenery and trees. There are many paths to spirituality, taking a long walk in wilderness is one of my personal favorites.\nEnergy and multiple orgasms This one surprised me. It turns out that men can have multiple orgasms. It involves some of the same breathing and mind discipline I learned in Zen. It also involves consciously channeling sexual energy through the body to redirect it from going to orgasm. The Tantrics in China did a lot of exploration into this. To a strict rationalist this sounds like mumbo-jumbo, but it is a demonstrably concrete physical phenomenon.\nThis one is worth pursuing for two reasons - it is a very pleasurable discipline, and it also demonstrates the amazing connections between mind, body, and our energy. Once I personally experienced changing my energy flows to do something that I thought impossible, I became a lot more curious and open to some of the New Age woo-woo talk about energy. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to completely understand it, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make exaggerated claims, but our control of our own energy levels is much more complex and powerful than a typical, limited rationalist view of the world would want to admit.\nSex and spirituality The more I pay attention during sex, the more powerful and profound it becomes. As I mentioned before, I discovered that sex for me has three levels - the body, the emotions, and the spirit. Quite often I approached (and sometimes still approach) sex as if I were happily munching through a bag of potato chips. That\u0026rsquo;s sex on the body level. Sex is such a powerful, body based experience that many of us get stuck here. Then I learned to open my heart to my partner. That\u0026rsquo;s sex on the emotional level. Finally, I started to pay close attention to the energy exchange between my partner and myself. That is sex on the spiritual level. I found that this feeling of spirituality (or energy level if you prefer), showed up nowhere more strongly than in sex.\nSelf-Healing A constant \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; with drug tests is that annoying placebo effect. It turns out that people can consciously will themselves to get better simply by believing they are taking a powerful drug when in fact they are just taking an inert placebo pill. This is truly amazing.\nIn my mid thirties, I developed a very dangerous and painful tumor in my spinal column. Despite the fact that it was life threatening, it was one of the times I was most powerful. I interviewed for and got a very demanding position at work. A dear friend came to visit me after the surgery, and we laughed when we realized that I was giving comfort and strength to him instead of the other way around.\nOne big problem, though, was that in removing the tumor, the surgeon had to remove a large chunk of the nerve connections to my left arm. One of my doctors looked at the body as a machine and was quite firm in telling me that there was no way I was going to regain the lost functionality. How could I? \u0026ndash; The nerves controlling it were completely removed. The actual surgeon, though, told me that we don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand the body mind connection, and it is hard to predict exactly what could be re-established.\nSo there I sat in my hospital bed, feeling very powerful and determined to do whatever I could to help my mind fully reconnect to my arm. I consciously poured as much love as I could into my poor damaged arm. Later that night I felt a tremendous wave of energy that flowed starting from my left side, then throughout my body and then seemed to fill the entire room with energy. It was incredible. It felt like being kissed by an angel. Now I hasten to add that despite this experience I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a religious conversion. I still don\u0026rsquo;t believe in some patriarchal (or matriarchal ) God sitting in heaven with their white robed angels. But now from direct personal experience I do know that there are states of consciousness that I never even dreamed possible while I was living firmly in my rational world. And as for my arm, I made a complete recovery - I regained complete control. The second doctor was right. I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure that my mental efforts added to this, but I also can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure that they didn\u0026rsquo;t. And I sure know that I experienced something extraordinary.\nEmotions What about emotions? Where do they fit in? The traditional view on emotions is that they are separate from rational thought. You can either think emotionally or you can think rationally, but not both at the same time. Star Trek\u0026rsquo;s Spock, my former idol, was a great proponent of this. I no longer believe it. I think that everything we do is accompanied by emotion including rational thought. When I am working through a computer problem I tend to feel calm and serene - these are emotions that I treasure and are a huge part of the reason I am such a rationalist. I make a point of returning to this serene space as much as possible. There has been recent psychological research to show that emotions and rational thought are much more intertwined than we previously believed. So, for me, emotions are an intrinsic part of all our experience, sometimes they are very intense and sometimes they are almost unnoticeable, but they are always with us. And yes, they are a source of knowledge in the same way that any of my body\u0026rsquo;s senses are a source of knowledge. But I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that they are independent of all my other mental states, I think they are just an important part of being self-aware.\nt turns out that reason and emotion are not as separate as Descartes thought.

	"content": " I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.” Joseph Campbell\n\u0026ldquo;Organicity\u0026rdquo; is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. My partner also initially really disliked it but try as we might we couldn’t come up with an alternative. Surprisingly this eventually became her favorite principal (possibly because it is the only one she remembers). Because we really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines \u0026ldquo;organism\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;icity\u0026rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. When a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died of cancer I was devastated. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. That was comforting to hear. The counselor was reminding me to trust myself. To trust the organism that is myself to guide me.\nFollow your joy I love to run. I have run pretty much my whole life. We as a species were born to run. Then why don’t more of us run? I have a theory. First of all a lot of people maybe never get past how hard it is initially. It takes at least a couple of weeks before it can feel really good. But even then many people force themselves to do it. I’ve seen lots of people set some huge goal like a marathon and actually achieve it only to never want to run again. Worse they sometimes push themselves so hard that they injure themself. Why would you want to keep on doing that? It works much better if you simply decide to run just for joy. I made a deal with myself that if ever after the first five minutes or so (it takes a bit to get going) I wanted to not run that day I would just stop. And here is the important thing — I honored that deal. It wasn’t often but every now and then I would just not be into it so I would stop. No beating myself up or second guessing myself, I just wasn’t in to it that day. And it worked! Sometimes running slowly sometimes sprinting so fast it felt like flying I would follow the joy in that moment. Eventually I found myself running for several hours — I probably ran close to half a marathon just for joy.\n“Move in a way that makes your body feel good!” says my wise yoga instructor. This is the heart of it. Look for joy moment to moment. Trust and know that it really wants to happen, and just get out of the way.\nGetting unblocked But quite often something is blocking us. Sometimes we don’t know how to get out of the way. When I stood in front of that workshop room struggling to make the commitment to lead a deep, rich, meaningful life, I was really stuck. The facilitator then asked the group, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who believes he deserves this please stand\u0026rdquo;. And everyone stood. As I stood there sobbing something shifted inside me. I could feel it. Something in me that had been blocked was now flowing. That was a moment of organicity. I was still struggling with what I had to do next, but this internal knowing was driving me forward. Guiding me.\nThis getting unblocked is the core of Hakomi. Hakomi therapists help us get to those deep, core beliefs we made when we got really, really hurt. They teach us to honor those beliefs because they got us through. We survived and those beliefs were a kind of genius. They gave us a way to survive. But we now see that the cost is too high and maybe there is another way. What is this organism longing for? Trust that. What is holding us back? Work with that. What wants to happen next? Trust that internal knowing and follow it. For me as therapist this was quite humbling. I was not the healer. I was just the support crew. I had to surrender control \u0026ndash; it was a leap of faith to simply trust organicity and I struggled with it. It was surprisingly hard to simply ask my client \u0026ldquo;What wants to happen next?\u0026rdquo;, and to trust that something may come to them or not and either way it was good. I had this mistaken notion that I needed to constantly direct things. But that is not how healing works \u0026ndash; it always comes from within. Again, organicity is the core of Hakomi.\nBut this is not just a Hakomi principle. Forest bathing guides know that it is the forest that holds the answers for their participants, they are just opening the door. The more than human world will provide exactly what is needed. People just need a little support to step into that other, liminal world that is just right there. Every organism innately knows what is best for it. And organisms need to be with each other. Forest bathing reintroduces us to that wider world of relationship. Guides are taught to offer gentle suggestions for activities and then to step back and trust whatever happens next.\nHAI also is grounded in organicity. HAI workshops immerse people into loving connection with themself and others. From that place of support and non-judgment people can discover what is blocking them and move past it. When they step up, usually naked to the microphone on Sunday there quite often is a sense of new worlds opening for them. HAI sets up an incredibly loving, safe environment and then steps back and waits for the magic to happen. That is the heart of organicity. HAI does very little explicit teaching. They don’t tell you what is wrong with you. Instead it creates an environment of loving support and steps back to watch the magic happen all on its own.\nHave there been times when you too when you felt very clear on what had to happen next? Maybe you had been putting something off for a long time, but now it was so clear that it was time. Feeling within this tremendous knowing that something has to change. It is a very vulnerable, but oddly powerful place to be in isn’t it. Let’s go there next.\n"

	"content": "Save The World Books This is a list of the books that have a plan to save the world. There are surprisingly few of them. Most are not well known.\nCommunity Peter Block works with communities to help them find their voice and power. This book is a guide to what seems to work the best. Val Hammel is using this as a guide to how she can revitalize HAI and make it flourish. She thinks the way to save the world is to rebuild our communities. I strongly agree with her.\nThe book is a little heavy on theory early on. Val recommends skipping ahead to where Peter gets into concrete examples first to better understand what he is saying. It probably would have worked better if Peter had flipped the order of the book. First give the examples of communities he has worked with and then later on talk about theory.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Yellow SecondAwakening Integral Theory, personal growth movement, medicine movement A life worth living At some point we need to turn back to ourselves to find the Truth of things. We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we are not at peace with ourselves. Green by itself won\u0026rsquo;t get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won\u0026rsquo;t heal the world. People insist on going their own selfish ways no matter how patiently we explain to them how crazy and evil they are. Then we try a little louder and slower, like you might to someone who does not speak English well. You. are. crazy. And. Evil! Huh. How can they not understand that?!? Why don\u0026rsquo;t they understand how crazy and evil they are?!? Maybe we are missing something? Perhaps there is a deeper stage to go here? Maybe just maybe there is something more workable than dividing the world up into good and evil? But to convince you of that I need for you to go very deeply into yourself. Kind of like an odyssey of the soul. It can be a bit scary and painful, but there is also wonder and joy. It feels like Odysseus tied to his ship’s mast finally surrendering, cutting his ropes, and jumping off to join the Sirens. Giving up this life so that he can know what worlds come after.\nAnd after we come up for air we are awakening all over again. We are right back to Beige staring in awe at the moon. It is exactly the same and yet different because this time we have the lived experience of so many previous generations. At Green we might dabble with Native American traditions, but it is at this Yellow stage where we truly get how much we can learn from these ancient cultures. And we find an incredible longing to go back to that way of life. But we can\u0026rsquo;t go back. We scuttled our ships on the beach and the only way now is forward. Or die. The first step is to find our own strength and truth. It has to start here. Stop, breathe, spend time in nature and really look at ourselves. And what we find is that we are vast beyond imagining. There are so many ways to be human. And we welcome all of ourselves. Not just the bright pretty parts but the scary dangerous parts as well. Not just the perfect (and yes we welcome our own perfection!) but also the broken and hurting parts as well. All of us. The mother/father, shaman/hunter, empress/slave, monk/holy-woman, scientist/worker, activist/follower, seeker. All of me. All of you. All of us.\nUp to now I could point to well known, big historical shifts. You can argue that I am vastly over simplifying history (because in fact I am), but you can not really argue that there have not been powerful, historical shifts in human consciousness. This stage, though, is just getting started and therefore I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of history to point at. There are more people waking up to this stage than you would suspect and yet I don\u0026rsquo;t think we have properly fully entered this stage. Who is at this stage? Probably you. The simple fact that you have read this far means you are at least are willing to look beyond the limitations of Green. Welcome!\nSecond Tier Something different happens at this stage than all the other stages. Spiral Dynamics calls this Yellow stage the start of a whole new tier; the second tier. Unlike the first tier stages, second tier stages recognize that all the stages have their place within us. Each stage has its own time and place. Up to this point emerging stages tended to hate the stages before them. But at second tier we stop the hating simply because it serves no purpose. Categorizing people as crazy and evil is mostly a waste of time — we are too busy trying to get stuff done. Yellow stage wizards learn to work effectively with people at all the different stages.\nAn example of a Yellow wizard is Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS. He has skillfully managed to steer both MDMA therapy and mushroom therapy through rigorous FDA trials. MDMA therapy has already been granted \u0026ldquo;breakthrough\u0026rdquo; status and it is only a matter of time before both are fully approved medical treatments. People kind of take this for granted, but they forget the fanatical war on drugs mentality he has had to patiently contend with. And that he got the Trump administration to sign off on all of this.\nKen Wilber calls this second tier the Integral stage. He points out that we no longer live in a separated world. The wisdom of all the traditions is available, and we should recognize that they all have valuable lessons. When we reach this tier we have a special responsibility to the world. We see a little clearer and further than others on certain matters. We start to see that all the stages have their own inherent logic and use, but also that each of the first tier stages has dangerous blindspots that have to be managed and navigated. It is an act of moral cowardice to not accept this responsibility. Global warming is real, and if not addressed could end up triggering a chain of events where billions die. Democracies quite often are overthrown by authoritarians and then there is great suffering and death. Some courses of action are better than others. To choose to not act is itself an act.\nTick-Tock pendulum swings Then there is what I call the tick-tock part of Spiral Dynamics. The focus at each stage flips back and forth between the individual (tick) and the group (tock). But each each stage is \u0026ldquo;higher\u0026rdquo; than the last so we are spiraling between these two poles.\nBeige woke us up as individuals - tick.\nPurple gathered us together as tribe \u0026ndash; tock.\nRed struck out towards individual Godhood \u0026ndash; tick.\nBlue brought us back to a community honoring Truth \u0026ndash; tock.\nOrange released us to find our rational truth \u0026ndash; tick.\nGreen brought us back to protecting us all \u0026ndash; tock.\nYellow, echoing Beige, steps deeply into individual discovery all over again (tick).\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end here. The next stage will bring us back together once more \u0026ndash; tock.\n"

	"content": "When I first started telling people the Spiral Dynamics story I hoped it would wake them up to Turquoise all by it self. But nope. Most people are not quite ready yet. I feel like a popcorn kernel that has popped a little earlier than the rest. I hope and pray that it is just a matter of time before the rest of the kernels start popping so I can nestle in with them, but in the meantime it looks like I have some work to do.\nDo you remember my proposed plan? Here again are the key things that have been holding us back. We need:\nA Better Story Wider Healing Unity Consciousness A Bigger Dream And this is how we are going to get there:\nGrowing Up Cleaning Up Waking Up Showing Up Wising Up We have been working on Growing Up. I started here because without a coherent story we are stumbling around blind. Blue religions tell us to just trust God and everything will be fine. It won\u0026rsquo;t be. Orange scientists understand global warming but not people. Green activists understand the deep injustices of the world, but not how to fix it. Not really. Yellow seekers see no alternative but to watch the world burn. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur to them to join with others. So we have to waken Turquoise. We are much bigger than we think. We are bigger than our story, bigger than our fears. If we can get people out of survival mode and into the vast place of self-actualization we will change the world. So how do we get to Turquoise? We need to step through all the stages again but at a deeper level this time.\nTic-Toc Each turn of the spiral takes us from individual (tic) to community (toc). And each turn is kind of a complete unit all by itself. A fancy word for this is dialectic. We start with an idea (thesis) and then we have an opposing idea (antithesis) and after much struggle we end up with something that combines the best of both (synthesis). For example with Red and Blue we started with the wild claim that humans can be as gods, and then synthesized that into something even bigger but still acknowledging human divinity.\nCleaning Up, Waking Up, Showing Up, and Wising Up each correspond to one turn of the spiral:\nBeige and Purple ==\u0026gt; Cleaning Up Red and Blue ==\u0026gt; Waking Up Orange and Green ==\u0026gt; Showing Up Yellow and Turquoise ==\u0026gt; Wising Up Cleaning Up Cleaning Up gives us a deep rich fulfilling life. Beige and Purple will lead us there. Beige gives us back our bodies. Brings back connection with nature and sexuality. Here we work with our trauma and wounds. Purple puts us in a healing community that supports and inspires us to grow. It provides a culture that encourages us to take on healthier, wiser life practices. We are never done with this growth work. These two stages go together. We do a little healing work which allows us to grow a little which then enables us to do some more healing work. Until one day we look up and realize we are in joy.\nWaking Up Waking Up is about stepping into something bigger than ourselves. Red and Blue will lead us there. Religion has been misused in such horrible ways that many have developed a strong aversion to it. They are right — we can be very dark indeed and that has shown up in our religions. So that is where we have to start. We are creatures of both light and darkness. We need to embrace both. Red took us to a very dark place. But it is part of who we are. So first we accept that darkness. Accept that burning need for domination and hierarchy. And celebrate it! We need our wild warrior to stand up and shout I will conquer this world!\nBut conquer it for what? How do we channel our sacred anger? Our shadow and light are interwoven. The world is deeply suffering but at the very same time we are surrounded by oceans of love just begging to be let in. And yet we stumble along with this sad illusion that we are separate and lonely. Caught up in the scary story that the universe is harsh and that we all die alone. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. Those stories are just stories. There is a deeper truth to be found. It is not so much that we need to expand our hearts as that we need to remember our hearts have always been one.\nShowing Up Showing Up has us making real changes to the world. Orange and Green take the lead here. Orange brings that ferocious drive for Truth that doesn’t let us just meander self indulgently. What is the core of the matter? Let’s get to it! Are we actually improving the world? Let’s measure it. Got a working prototype of something that seems to work? Great! Now let’s scale it up!\nGreen guides us back to group wisdom and justice. Once we understand the science part of the plan we next need to make sure we don’t just bulldoze our way there. That doesn’t work — we need to bring in Green’s ecological way of thinking to make sure that we don’t fix one problem only to create new injustices.\nWising Up Wising Up is about figuring out what we came to Earth to do. And once we get really clear on that we will also get clear that we can not do it alone. Yellow and Turquoise take the lead here. We need people to first wake up to what it is they are here for (Yellow) and then for them to realize they can\u0026rsquo;t get there on just their own (Turquoise). We are going to have to get there together. We need to come together as one in community. And this community is already here we just need to believe in it.\nThis sacred community celebrates all of us. We bring our vibrant animal natures (Beige). We create sustainable, spiritual, loving community (Purple). We step into those incredibly challenging conversations and confrontations (Red). We commit to those wild dreams of something greater than ourselves (Blue). We honor the beautiful Truth of science and reason to see more clearly (Orange). We tend to the wounds of the oppressed and reclaim our natural equality (Green). We hone our Spiral wizardry to meet people where they are and actually get stuff done (Yellow). We wake up to our full strength and then look out to others (Turquoise). And then just maybe we can step into that more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.\nTowards Turquoise Turquoise is where we will finally find our way back to what we knew at Purple. We burned our bridges at Red and no longer can go back. We have to push forward through Blue, Orange, Green, and Yellow before we finally can make it home again. We need to fully embrace and welcome all of the stages before we finally step into Turquoise. Each stage is part of the solution. We need them all.\nTurquoise whole heartedly loves and embraces all that we are. Revels in both our light and dark. This is what wants to happen if only we can get out of our own way. I think the very first step is to hold in our hearts that this huge dream is possible. That it is mainly our fears and habits that are holding us back. We forget how huge we are. It is time to remember.\nTurquoise will be beautiful. People will go back to a full freedom they have not had for a very long time. We will once again live in sacred harmony with the land. Forests and rivers will stop being just resources to extract and will again be holy land. Our land helps feed us, yes, but also nourishes our soul. Children will run free and be loved by the whole village. We will help each of them find their reason for coming to Earth. Elders will achieve a certain wisdom and mentor the younger generations. No more traumas passed from generation to generation. No more genocide. No more senseless wars. This is possible. It truly is. But not if we continue as we are. We need a plan, a really huge, sweeping dream of a plan. And once more I ask you. Will you join me? I think I really do know what I am asking of you. Please join me anyways.\n"

	"content": "I recently watch a movie called Manchester by the Sea. The acting is amazing and the overall quality is very high. But I don’t recommend the movie. At all. I think the movie in its confusion and ignorance promotes a very dangerous story. It portrays deeply, deeply traumatized people stumbling around causing harm to themselves and others without any recognition that it doesn’t have to be like that. It is caught in the harmful story that there is nothing you can do to heal trauma. It is as if the actors portrayed burn victims just making do with their festering wounds and just accepting that it had to be that way. Hospitals?!? Pffft. As if. Real people just suffer. This is dangerous, ignorant nonsense. But it is understandable. Up to now that is all we knew. We have only recently rediscovered what Purple knew all along — we can heal trauma. But we have to first accept that this is even possible.\nI keep on coming back to The Body Keeps the Score (you are going to read this book right? 😉) because it is so foundational. Bessel van der Kolk does such a good job of showing how pervasive and damaging trauma is, but then gives us such hope! The second half lists many, many different promising approaches to trauma. Pretty much all of them have you reconnect to your body. A surprising number of them involve do complicated things as a group work (eg. theatre, dance, singing). And they are helping! I personally have seen how just one of the listed therapies, MDMA, can dramatically help. Probably the biggest work we have to do here is to simply get the word out. If I could rewrite Manchester by the Sea I would show the main character going into MDMA treatment and follow them as they go up and down through the difficult healing process. It would be cathartic to watch — lots of crying involved — and I promise you very compelling. People need to know this healing is possible. To stop telling ourselves that awful, false story that there is nothing you can do. There is an urgent need to scale up these treatments and make them much cheaper. They need to be available to everyone — cost should not be a blocker. And this has to be our priority. But how we do it is important too.\nOnce MDMA becomes fully legal again there will undoubtedly be a huge number of commercial MDMA clinics opening up. Plans for this are already well under way. The need for healing trauma is so huge that maybe this is OK — we need as many people treated as soon as possible. But we would also lose something very important. Currently Medicine work is usually carried out as a Shamanic healing. The healers are taught to respect the indigenous lineage of this work. And much of this healing work is done in groups. This is how it used to be done way back — this work connects us to our Purple heritage. And you don’t have to take a (currently) illegal substance to do this work. HAI also is a kind of Medicine work. HAI gets you to much the same space as taking MDMA only HAI does it naturally by increasing oxytocin and the like. When I first started doing MDMA work it felt very familiar. It was kind of like I had already done a lot of that work. It turns out I had — I just had done it at HAI workshops. But most people don’t even know how powerful healing in a group can be. How do we spread the word? Include it as part of general education. That is a pretty big topic — I will come back to that later, but basically we need to really expand the scope of what we teach our children to include things like healing and group work.\nI get so caught up in the hard parts of change but I don’t want you to miss out on the joyous parts too. There is one more super important aspect of Change that I haven’t talked about yet. Creativity. Creativity is the heart and soul of the Change principle. It is something to cultivate in ourselves. It is what sparks that joyous realization of Wait! I have an idea! What about…And then a new world of possibility opens up. Remember how good it feels to dive into a new project that you are excited about? How you were buzzing with all these ideas of what you could do? Creativity lights us up. This also is a vital part of Change. Besides being a wonderful and necessary thing all by itself it also turns out to be an important tool for healing. The The Body Keeps the Score recognizes things like expressive art and writing as trauma healing methods. We need to encourage our children’s natural creativity all through their years of schooling not just in kindergarten. And we should not just teach individual creativity but we should teach group creativity as well. For when all voices are heard and valued a group can become much bigger than its parts. And a group as a whole can have a joyous creativity of its own — have you ever felt that? Let’s go to that next.\n"

	"content": "While I was writing this section, I had a urinary infection that made it painful to pee. I kept on ignoring and ignoring it for two weeks. Finally it got so painful even I could no longer ignore it so I went into urgent care and got a prescription that cleared me up pretty much in one day. Why did I wait so long? Now with the infection gone I realize how much it was weighing on me. I feel so much better now and have so much more energy! It was blocking me from fully showing up.\nI knew what to do, but a very old story was blocking me. Don’t make a fuss! Don’t ask for too much — people who ask for too much are not lovable. These are some of the stories that were blocking me. In this case it took waking up in so much pain that I could not go back to sleep before I took action. That is unfortunately pretty common — we wait until the pain becomes so unbearable that we finally are driven do something different. It doesn’t have to be like that.\nWhen my son was in college I would visit once a month and take him and his girl friend out to lunch. We all loved Thai food so we often chose that. One day after lunch we came back to their dorm and I just had to crash on their couch. My son was concerned and started saying to his girlfriend, “This is not right. Something is really wrong here”. They were talking about me as if I was not there. I wanted to say, “I’m still right here you know!”, but couldn’t quite manage. I was in basically a food coma. Finally I was able to get off the couch and forced myself to go on a long walk with them. That rallied me enough so that I could do the two hour drive home. But I had to agree with my son. Something was not right.\nMy body was telling me that it no longer could handle high carb food. It was time for me to listen. Of course I didn’t. Give up my beloved cereal in the morning?! Give up sushi?! No way. I was also about twenty five pounds overweight and, according to the charts, obese. I tried low carb diets as a technical hack to lose weight quickly. They worked, but then as soon as I was off the diet my weight would swing right back up. I was yo-yoing up and down ten or more pounds. And a diet that let me eat a pound of bacon for breakfast was not in any way a healthy diet. My body made sure to let me know it, not that I was paying any attention. My ex took to calling me “sausage boy” for all the sausages I would stuff down.\nRight before my fiftieth birthday I did a HAI weekend workshop that changed everything. I had an aha moment very similar to when I originally made my first sacred vow. This time I committed to loving myself unconditionally and all the way. Truly committed to it. For most of my life I have worked hard at learning to love myself but it is not something you just do once and then are done with it. It is kind of like exercise — something you have to do day after day, month after month, year after year. And there was something about this particular HAI workshop that let me finally finally commit to loving myself deeply. I was already committed to living a deep, rich, fulfilling life. Now it was time to step into something even deeper. With my 50th birthday I was officially no longer young so committed to aging as gracefully and beautifully as possible. Every morning I would wake up and lovingly look at my belly and think, maybe a little less food would be best. And food that makes me feel good. And it worked! The extra pounds melted away and stayed off. It felt like I was finally working in partnership with my body rather than starving it. We were working as one now. My body got that I was truly committed to what was best, and started to trust my guidance. It hadn’t trusted me up to then and maybe for good reason.\nThis is harmony amongst the different parts is what we are aiming for. Once we have made our brave change, we need to welcome this new thing and really make it part of ourselves. This is the principle of Unity. Let’s talk about that next.\n"

	"content": "Life is a rich and varied banquet. Rationalists that stay safe in only their rational minds are missing out on the full richness of being human. When I try to talk about this with my rationalist friends it is somewhat frustrating - I end up basically saying, yes, pizza is one of my favorite foods too, but there is so much else out there as well, why not do a little more exploring?\nSo what do I know now that I didn\u0026rsquo;t back on that picnic bench at University of Chicago?\nI have learned how to bring up other parts of myself to deal with such a deep crisis as that young lady faced \u0026ndash; this is one case where my rational mind would take a back seat. Simply being alive, even in pain is a good thing that needs celebrating. But almost certainly the core of her problem was self-hate and serious depression. I now know a lot about self-hate, and suicide is the ultimate expression of self-hate. The path back from suicide is learning to love oneself, and that almost inevitably touches upon what I call spirituality. I also know about crushing depression, and the solution is to recognize that it is a whole body problem, and needs a whole body treatment that includes exercise, diet, mood enhancers (like St. John\u0026rsquo;s Wort or even possibly prescription drugs), a change in thinking, and of course spiritual work. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much a case that Kant, the genius rationalist philosopher, was wrong, but simply that what he had to say wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly useful in this case.\nThe reason I felt so conflicted during our conversation was that I had been following a jealous God. Strict rationalists, along with many Christians, believe that they are following the one True faith, and everyone else is just a deluded infidel. But what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know at the time is that it is possible to make deep use of reason without being such a narrow, intolerant fundamentalist. It turns out that there are many paths to Truth, and rationality is just one of them. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to welcome and honor all of my mind/body faculties. When I live in balance with my heart, mind, and spirit, I find my life to be most fulfilling. When I get out of balance, it is ultimately unhealthy. That is why I ultimately left both the University of Chicago, and the Zen monastery - both were very useful training grounds, but both were in the end very unbalanced.\n"

	"content": " Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for Turqoise PromisedLand Just starting to emerge Save the world After finding our vast strength in Yellow we start to really open up to all that is. And it hurts. Really hurts. The world is suffering in so many needless ways. Before when we met this pain we ran away, but now we start to realize how truly big we are. We are more than just our narrow individual ego. We are part of something so so much bigger. Big enough even to face that scary tidal wave of world pain. We are all one. When you suffer, I suffer too. We now start to really get that. And it is so not OK what is happening. Just finding our own joy is no longer enough. The deeper joy is the joy of all. This puts us in a really big, strong place. Standing in this place of strength we now cast our gaze outwards. And a wild, crazy hope emerges. On our own there is relatively little we can do. But together? Together we can change the world.\nTurquoise as a societal construct is not yet here. There is no history I can point to. So we don\u0026rsquo;t really know yet exactly what Turquoise is going to look like. But we do have the pattern of what has happened up to now to give us some important clues. We know that this stage will be the (tock) return to community. And just like Yellow revisits Beige at a higher stage, Turquoise revisits Purple. We will know Turquoise has arrived by its awesome, legendary parties. Burning Man might be an early yearning towards this. Just like Purple was the start of religion, Turquoise almost certainly will see the rebirth of an enlightened form of religion. It will be a practice of spirit that deeply nourishes and strengthens. And we will become bad-asses once more.\nTurquoise is like a prophecy in a story. It is a dream of what we hope and pray will come. And it can be our intention. Our guide of what needs to happen in order for the world to flourish. But even though Turquoise is not yet fully here I do see some signs of it starting to emerge. Valerie Kaur\u0026rsquo;s Revolutionary Love Project is one example.\nPlease watch her Ted talk. It is a great review of everything I have talked about so far. I sincerely doubt that she is aware of Spiral Dynamics, but that makes this even more compelling of an example. She takes us through all the stages and ends with a call for us all to unite to save the world.\nSee if you can recognize all the different Spiral stages as she brings them up:\nHow many did you get?\nBeige She starts out with the pain of giving birth. And her family is there with her; primal, intense Beige.\nPurple She has a vision of all the mothers who gave birth before, supporting her in a long line; sacred, tribal Purple.\nRed Her Grandfather admonishes her to be a warrior. \u0026ldquo;You will not abandon the fight. Don\u0026rsquo;t abandon your post\u0026rdquo;; healthy, strong Red.\nBlue She talks about how her Sikh religion has guided her; beautiful, true Blue.\nOrange She talks about how the lawyer part of herself is a little uncomfortable with all this love talk; classic Orange\nGreen She talks about her inspiring social justice work; amazing, vibrant Green\nYellow She talks about her inner work of learning to love herself; awakening, deepening Yellow\nTurquoise And then she looks up and out to call all of us to join her; triumphant Turquoise\nNotice how lovingly she talks about all the stages. This is a key difference from Yellow. Instead of just tolerating the other stages and working with them, Turquoise actively loves all the stages and celebrates them. Notice how she asks us to first find our strength within (breathe and push) before then looking out to others. Turquoise can only emerge after people have done the hard individual Yellow work first.\nI find it incredibly hopeful that this stage is just starting to awaken exactly at the exact point when we need it most. We have a choice. We already have enough food to feed the world, but we choose not to. We already have enough medicine to heal all the world\u0026rsquo;s sick, but we choose not to. We already have the technology to completely stop C02 emissions, but we choose not to. We are not lacking in resources or technology. What we are missing is that bigger consciousness. Way too many of us are still asleep. This stage, if it arrives in time, will wake us up.\n"

	"content": "Again, Americans have a huge blindspot about groups. We just don’t seem to get that not everything is just about me. When I try to explain this to people I sometimes get frustrated until I remember it took me an entire year of living in Japan and married to a Japanese woman to get this — no wonder people don’t get it. It is like trying to talk to fish about the water they are swimming in. Water? What are you talking about? And yet we are all floating around in this trance of the rugged individualist. I see it in all sorts of places. It is what makes driving so scary sometimes. When I drive in California I have to remember that most of the other drivers seem to believe they are in a driving game and consider all the other drivers to be just npc’s — not real. To stay safe I have to just assume people will act in selfish, random ways and not get too flustered by the occasional road rage incident. Again, I’m not real to them. And they certainly don’t have any conception of being part of a greater whole — at least not while they are driving. This attitude shows up in how we do our healing work as well.\nMany people are discovering the power of therapy. A lot of therapists are now actually worth visiting; they have practical, useful techniques that really help. It wasn’t always that way, but I think those bad days are mostly past. But therapy is a very individualistic path. It is incredibly necessary and useful for healing work around, say, deep trauma work, but it doesn’t have much to say about the wisdom traditions that we also need. People do great healing work with a therapist, and get to a point where they want to continue their journey even deeper. And both they and the therapist then don’t really know what to do. This is where group work comes in. It is how people get to that next level.\nAnd we crave the group experience. We were born for it. There is a beautiful group connection magic that comes when we go through something intense together. People connect and become one. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also. When someone does some work for themselves they are doing work for me as well. This is one reason why HAI creates so much space for sharing, because we can learn so much from each other. The other reason is that when we are in a safe, deeply connected group like this, people become our sacred witness. When I state that I am committed to loving the hurt little boy inside myself to the group, that becomes a sacred vow. There is something incredibly healing to be witnessed in this way.\nWhat works best is for a group to create a truly safe space for doing vulnerable shares. Safe enough to show up as who we truly are. Not just the facade that we want people to see, but all of us. And when we see someone sharing vulnerably the full extent of their pain, we quite often have a moment of “Oh! That is me! I have that too!”. They are doing the work for everyone in the room — everyone watching starts to take on that work as well. And one person’s courage gives rise to another person’s. It is a beautiful, upward spiral towards healing. People come up to the front of the room to share all sorts of diverse ways of being human. And we start to recognize all parts of ourself. We start to recognize that people are just a different kind of mirror we can look into.\nDoes that make sense? That other people are a mirror for us? Some people get this right away, but others struggle with it. There is a healthy way to do this and an unhealthy way. The unhealthy way is called “projection”, and the idea is that almost everything we see in others is our own projection onto that person. When we project we don’t even really see the other person just our own illusions. But there is also a deeper, healthier way to hold this. When we do this mirror work we recognize that there is no place of being human that we ourselves can’t get to. No matter how strange a place a person lands in, we all have the potential to go there too. This is easy to believe when you see someone who shares many things with you, like a friend. So you can see how they might be a mirror for you. It is harder to believe when you look at someone so different from you that you don’t even understand them. When I look at people like that I recognize that they have journeyed to a very different place than I have. I wonder what I might be like if I went to that same place. I know that it is possible. They are a mirror into that part of myself I have not yet discovered.\nThe next step in this mirror work is to realize that everything we resist in others is that which we resist in ourself. It is also true for emotional attraction. That which we love in others is that which we love in ourself. For example, for a long time I had a resistance to people who had deep, pitted acne scars. The first step was just to simply acknowledge that I had this resistance. Then it didn’t take too much investigation to realize that yep I truly hate my acne scars and here I was almost literally looking in the mirror and not liking what I saw. Sometimes it takes a little more investigation. For example, I sometimes have a resistance to people who are morbidly obese. It is tempting to simply dismiss this as simply not finding that attractive, but the truth is that I have off and on struggled with my weight my whole life. You wouldn’t know it to look at me but it is true. I have this secret fear of simply letting go and ballooning up to an enormous size. That seems like a real possibility. So when I see someone who is quite overweight my resistance comes from me projecting that fear (and judgment) onto that other person. I’m not even really looking at that person! All I can see is that thing I don’t like in myself. It is fine if you doubt this, all I ask is to really get mindful. Notice when you have a strong resistance (or emotional attraction) to someone and then just get curious about why that might be. Hold open the possibility that what you are resisting (or attracted to) is some quite possibly deeply buried part of yourself that you don’t like.\nAnd just like we need to work on looking into a mirror and loving who we see no matter what, we also need to learn to look at others and love what we see, no matter what. That brings us back to the Love principle. Let’s go there next.\n"

	"content": "The Unity principle at Red brings us back to knowing that we all have the rapist and murderer inside of us. We all embody both Trump and Hitler. They are not separate from us. Do you recoil from that? I know I certainly do. That can’t be true! But it is.\nTime for confession. During this latest pandemic surge I did the math for how many amongst the vaccine refusers were Trump supporters. I wanted to see if the number of their deaths would change anything politically. The super dark side of this? I was hoping it would. Do you know who else had this kind of mindset? Hitler. If only we got rid of “those” people things would be so much better. Again we have to step back from “good” and “evil”. When we point our finger at “those” people there are three fingers pointing right back at us.\nAs I write this, I’m writing with a heart smashed into a million pieces. My partner, the one I thought I was going to die with jumped into an emotional affair with another man. He became the main focus of her romantic attraction, and when caught she completely denied she had done anything wrong. So what does this have to do with the unity principle? In my previous marriage I cheated several times on my wife, and I also steadfastly didn’t believe I had really done anything wrong. So yes, Karma is a bitch, but even more importantly I need to see that my partner is just another mirror. I might not like what I see, but there it is. I’m rightfully quite hurt, but a lot of that anger I’m sending her way? Really that anger is about the cheater in me. And now the circle is complete and I finally realize, oh this is what it feels like to have your trust betrayed. I keep on wondering why can’t she understand how painful this is to me?!? And then I can look into the mirror and remember that I also didn’t understand really understand why my wife’s pain. I didn’t really understand because I had never gone through that particular pain myself.\nWhen a car driver treated me like just potential bug-splatter, I found a crazy amount of rage inside. Enough rage to do incredibly rash, stupid things. And worse, if I’m honest I found that I really love that crazy wild energy. I can easily see how anger can be addictive. And then I look at people who go to Trump rallies to get their fix of anger. Instead of judging them I need to remember yet again I’m looking into a mirror and not liking what I see. I also could get easily addicted to rage. I also could get so angry about our broken, corrupt system that I want to just burn it all down and try something new. So all that anger I have at those other angry people? Shouting at my reflection in the mirror.\nThis mirror work at Red is not all just the hard things. It works the other way too. That crazy drive to conquer the world and then actually succeed that is in all of us too. That beautiful, righteous anger that made Martin Luther King so powerful is also in all of us. It took me the very longest time to realize I can be a leader. When I was in Boy Scouts they went on and on about leadership and I always thought why don’t they just take the boys that are the obvious leaders into another room and talk to them about this stuff. This is just so irrelevant to an obvious non leader like me. I realize now that I shrank back from leadership because even as a child I associate strong domineering men (which is the usual stereotype of leadership) as the root cause of much of the suffering. The truth is there is a bit of domineering involved with most leadership, the trick is to harness it to do the right thing instead of the harmful, selfish thing. And even more important though is to fully accept the part of me that wants to dominate. To celebrate the part that wants to throw my partner hard on to the bed and have my way with her (with her previously negotiated explicit consent of course). I still struggle with that. Even when it is beyond clear that my partner loves this, I have to struggle to really acknowledge that yes that scary dominating monster is in me. Yet again when I’m looking at those dominating men, yet again I’m looking at a mirror.\nAnd what is the most important thing to do when looking at a mirror? Send as much love as possible to what you see. Time to yet again go back there.\n"

	"content": "We can have our ecstatic moments, but what really matters is what we bring back to our daily life. When starting a Medicine journey, quite often we struggle to surrender to the medicine, but once we do we almost always eventually end up in a beautiful spot. Maybe we wrap our arms around an angel and blast to another planet, or maybe we die and once we get past that horror find ourself in a world of peaceful joy where our painful body no longer troubles us. It can be hard to come back from that. But that is our work — integrating all this new experience. The initial journey is great, but it is in the follow up sessions with the therapist where the important work is done. The client now knows what is possible — the work is to fully bring it into themself and live from that place.\nHakomi is less dramatic, but the principle is exactly the same. The therapist helps a client dig down way deep to find the internal story that is causing so much pain — it is usually a story about themselves. Then the therapist helps unblock what wants to happen and a shift can happen which usually feels ecstatic and joyous. The therapist helps them feel all the way in their body how good and right it feels. Then encourages them to really own this new way of being. Again just like with Medicine work the key thing here is to have the client integrate this change into themselves and make it a part of them self. Something that was held apart is now part of a whole.\nForest bathing has us come back to relationship with the more then human world. We suffer when we hold ourselves separate from nature. Forest bathing first invites us to connect with all our senses. What are you hearing? What do you smell? Do you feel the heat of the sun on your arms? Do you see the sparkle of the river? Then there is an invitation to play a little bit with the forest. Maybe explore textures, or maybe just look way, way closer at things than we normally do. Later there is an invitation to just sit for a while in nature. Guides are careful not to explicitly call this “meditation” because that word has so much extra obligation and expectations these days. The invitation is simply a chance to reconnect with the greater than human world. To physically remind ourself that we are not separate, we are one with this world. How did we ever forget that?\nFeeling unity with something beautiful like nature is one thing, but what about the ugly, hard things? What about the parts of our selves that we hate or consider dangerous and bad? Yes, especially those parts need to be embraced and loved. I never said this work is easy! But maybe the most important thing I have to say in this entire essay is that we need to find unity with all of ourselves. Truly all of ourselves. Unity consciousness is going to change the world. But first we need to find it in ourselves. We are vast beyond all knowing. Can we embrace all that we are? Even the monster within? Learn to love it? How on earth can we do that? We need to adopt the practice of loving presence. That is where we always come back to. That is both the reward and destination for all this hard work we are doing.\nCan you see how all the principles come into play? We have to avoid the temptation of pushing people along faster than they are ready. You might see short term gains but then they will just relapse. So we have to start with non-violence and make sure we feel safe within. We need to trust that we won\u0026rsquo;t lash out at ourself when we figure something out. That allows us to simply get curious (truth), and start to watch ourselves carefully (mindfulness). That leads us to be here right now in our body (mind-body) and next we trust our internal knowing (organicity). We learn to cultivate this intuition. And where will this inner knowing lead us? We don\u0026rsquo;t know, but we do know it might be very different than what we have right now. It will be a change. And when we embrace this change we bring it all the way into ourself. We embrace it with our heart, mind, and body (unity). But there is a final step. After welcoming this new part of ourself we learn to love it. Lets go there next.\n"

	"content": "In Beige I introduced the loving kindness Metta practice. I didn’t really go into the details of how to do it because first you need to learn how to love yourself. And if you struggle with that then first focus on the people (or animals at least?) in your life that you love and then circle back to yourself. But now let’s go one step further. There is already a lot written on this topic and I don’t really want to duplicate that. So before we get into it please quickly scan through this website:\nhttps://positivepsychology.com/loving-kindness-meditation\nGo on I’ll wait — there is a lot there so just scan the site for now. Notice how this is yet another core Buddhist practice like mindfulness that modern psychology is just now starting to recognize as valuable. And just like with mindfulness when we look into it we find there are amazing benefits. Benefits like better health, enhanced well being, and improved relationships. It almost sounds too good to be true, right? But if anything I think this undersells it — this practice can lead to deep joy. It is one of the main reasons I wake up in joy most mornings.\nPlease consider taking this practice on. There are a number of different scripts that you can use. Find one that works for you. I particularly like Tara Brach’s approach, but it is important to find something the resonates with you. I have to confess, though, that I don’t do any of those scripts. For me the path started with that Findhorn workshop that taught me everyone is a mirror. I to see other people as mirrors of myself. And then I worked hard at loving every reflection I saw.\nI first used this with my acne scars. Looking at my own scars was really hard. I resisted it — way too painful. But looking at others was at least possible. I started to get mindful. What was happening as I looked at their scars? I noticed a revulsion. I was secretly, quietly rejecting them as ugly. But then I worked on having loving compassion for both them and their scars. I had compassion for how hard it is to be ugly in this world. It is not something people are even really allowed to talk about. I realized that when we look at a tree that is scarred we don’t hold it ugly so why would I hold people with scars as ugly either? And as I found compassion for them, almost by surprise I found compassion for myself and my ugliness. I had found another way to look at the mirror. When looking at them I was almost literally looking at myself. And when I learned to love them I was also learning to love myself.\nAnd this works not just for acne scars. It turns out that we are all mirrors for each other. If I see you raging I get to see myself when I’m angry. If I see you depressed I get to see that dejected, collapsed place I also go to. And just like how it was easier for me to look at other people’s scars with compassion, it sometimes is easier to look at other’s peoples suffering than my own. And when we find compassion for others we are also learning how to have compassion for ourself.\nThis is a very powerful path to follow. I wish more people knew about it. Start by noticing when you have a resistance to someone. Maybe pick something small to begin with. Then get really curious and mindful about what is going on with that resistance. Take on the possibility that this resistance is actually something you don’t like in yourself. And then work on loving that other person flaws and all. Notice any limiting stories you might have about whether it is possible to love everyone and let them go. Try taking on the new story that it is in fact possible to love everyone it just takes work, and then start doing it. Have compassion with yourself when you fail to do it perfectly. Again this practice takes work! And it is an ongoing practice, we never are really done with this work. But I promise you it is so worth it.\nLet me give a practical example. Currently I am working on loving very old people. Especially people who have become frail. See the thing is I’m getting old too and I desperately fear becoming helpless or even worse a burden to my loved ones. It is hard to look at the mirror and see the wrinkles and other signs of aging. And when I look at older people it is just another mirror for me. So I start there. Every time I see someone old and I feel resistance I work on letting that go and just loving them as they are. This is actually easier than looking at an actual mirror, surprisingly. And it is working! As I do this work I start to find a little more compassion for my own aging. I’m only part way on this path — lots of work still left though. Part of the problem is how unthinkingly ageist our society is. I have to teach myself to step out of that ugly prejudice we all seem to have against older people.\nOne of the best places to do this loving practice is in a personal growth group. Everyone’s heart is already opened and that makes it much easier. Enormous healing is available in this kind of group. When I am at a HAI weekend workshop I always look for the people in the group that I have resistance to. Then I make a point of especially loving those people. The more you do it the easier it becomes but this practice does take work. It is so worth it though! To be very clear I am not doing this loving practice for them — I am doing it for myself. They are just a mirror for something I still don’t have compassion for in myself. It’s gotten to the point where I really don’t see much difference between staring at a mirror trying to find compassion to staring at someone else trying to compassion. It seems like exactly the same work to me. Follow this practice far enough and you start to really get that we are all one. Really and truly one. But that maybe comes in later stages. For now it is enough to revel in and embrace the loving power of a group committed to love.\n"

	"content": " “People will only protect what they love.” Jacques Cousteau\nWhen I found out my beloved partner was maybe falling in love with another man I went through wild, manic swings. One moment I was pouring all my heart and soul into figuring out a way to fix it. Then I would get so angry I would clench my fists and shout. Then I got so sad that I couldn’t sleep. I went so many nights without sleep that when I shut my eyes I had vivid hallucinations. I’ve aways thought “heart breaking” was a poetic term. Nope, turns out it is a very real, physical thing. Where my love for her used to be was now a million scattered pieces of heart. Maybe I don’t love her anymore I told myself. Then I really let myself explore leaving her, and the pain got so great I didn’t know if I could bear it. We had created such a great life together, and created so many great memories. Sure I could probably find someone else, but I really don’t want to. To make it even more crazy making she was walking the El Camino in Spain for 8 weeks while this all blew up so we were physically distant. I sent her an angry email and was quite surprised that that didn’t immediately have her come running to me. Instead she told me she needed to process and pulled back from communicating with me except for brief superficial texts.\nI waited day after day for her to come back to connection with me. And each day I got more and more desperate. So I really pulled back my heart. Of course I did. This hurt too much. But one day it suddenly hit me — I made a sacred vow to love everyone, no kidding no exceptions. I was so not honoring that vow. But man this was hard. The perfect cosmic synchronicity that I just so happen to be writing about loving the hard things at the exact moment I am so angry at someone blows my mind. So I reread some of my articles here to remind me of who I am when I’m in my higher place. Huh. Not such bad advice, maybe I should follow it. Finally I surrendered to how deeply I love her. I love her with all my heart. I love her beyond beyond. She was my soulmate, the one I was going to die with. And I really stepped into the pain of losing that security that I was her one and only. That opened up a rush of energy and love. Turns out that choosing to hold back my love was even more painful than that initial hurt. Choosing love just feels so much better. I chose love not because it is the right thing to do (although it is), and not because it is what the world needs (although it does). Honestly? I chose love because it is the selfish path to joy for myself. When I don’t chose love I step into pain. Choosing love steps me into that bigger place in myself that feels amazing.\nBut still night after night I would obsess about what she should have done differently over and over. The first week it was kind of a juicy discussion. My internal audience was right there shouting Yea! Shame on her! But after a while it got boring even to me. But it kept on going on and on. Every night that she didn’t reach out to do a video chat I felt like I was going to die. I would wake up in a panic and fight myself (sometimes successfully sometimes not) to not send out a desperate text to her. Until one night I went to bed obsessing yet again about her, and in the middle of the night I startled awake with that same desperate need for her to reach out to me, but this time a little cloud creature appeared over my belly in a kind of waking dream. That little guy reassured me that I was not going to die. Everything was going to be OK. And I went into bliss. Getting out of all that pain and into bliss felt so good I actually was moaning the rest of the night. I think there was a little child really scared that if their parents were not there for them they were going to die. This goes all the way back to that time when my mom was too busy with three kids 1 and under to really have time for me. And as long as I kept my focus on that little creature all was bliss. But as soon as I went back to obsessing about her the bliss started to fade away. That little creature wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to prevent me from obsessing about her if that is what I really wanted, but it gently kept on reminding me that my bliss was back with me.\nSo that has been my challenge. Instead of continuing to demand something from someone who just is not able to give it, to instead bring the focus back on me. But man that is hard! I told a wise friend this story and she suggested that I get a plushie to hold and remind me where my source was. Hmm. Great idea. I turned to my daughter for advice on plushies — she is all about plushies. She happily took me to Target and helped me find the perfect one. It was so sweet to get her support on this. It turns out my spirit animal is a very cute turtle. At first I resisted it — turtles with their hard shells seemed a terrible spirit animal to support relationships. But then I realized how perfect it is. I tend to only let a select few in, but with those I let in I don’t set nice clear boundaries. But the turtle is strong and secure in itself. It doesn’t need to look anywhere else than itself for its safeness and strength. And because of that security it is possible for the turtle to stretch out into a really healthy vulnerability. The turtle knows where its source is.\nLast night I was again obsessing about what I want from her. But now my practice is to hear and honor her “no”. She can only offer what she can freely offer. Why would I want to force her into anything more? And I also can only offer what I can offer. It is perfectly ok for me at times to say “no”. Why would I want to force something on to myself? In fact almost always my saying “no” is way, way harder than hearing the other’s “no”. I caretake, and try to please. I try to earn love by doing selfless acts of service that are very hard. That can be quite lovely, but quite often I go to a point where I sacrifice and diminish myself. That is not serving me, or the other actually because it no longer is an act of love but desperation. It becomes a kind of bribe. A kind of transaction with the exchange rate running way against me. I value the worth of my love so little that at times I am willing to trade enormous acts of service for even the tiniest amount of love.\nBut my turtle spirit keeps on reminding me to come back to myself. Reminds me that my source is right here, beating in my chest. So what does this have to do with Red and Love? Embracing the warrior’s path. Individuation. Finding that core within and never letting go of it. Especially never letting go of it when dealing with others. Red is by far my weakest stage, and I’m coming to these realizations fairly late in life. But I think this is the way. Not just for me, and not just for doing relationships, but for doing all of life. My strength is not coming from out there. It is from within. Getting validations from others is wonderful, but at the end of the day my source is within. Love that fierce fighting spirit. Love that ferocious ability to defend. I am strong enough to do this. I am strong enough to do anything.\n"

	"content": " \u0026ldquo;All human behavior is either an act of love or a cry for love\u0026rdquo; Stan Dale (HAI founder)\n“The hardest to learn was the least complicated” Indigo Girls\nPlease consider Aaron Stark\u0026rsquo;s story about how he almost became a school shooter. What saved him? A friend\u0026rsquo;s undemanding love. The friend wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though Aaron had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there. Love freely given with no expectations. What a beautiful, simple, powerful gift. What would the world look like if more people got the love they needed? Please sit with that thought for a moment. Maybe breathe into it. It really is the core of my plan \u0026ndash; my longing is for us to all get back to here. To that place where we feel loved and are willing to take the scary risk of loving others. Loving others is a discipline that can be cultivated and strengthened until it is a way of life. Simple enough to say, but quite hard to do at times. For many of us the hardest to learn was the least complicated. We always have the choice; to love or not, to let love in or not. It is fear and pain that holds us back. That is not where we truly want to be. But to get where we want to go we often need help. We need training.\nThe Buddhists have a beautiful exercise called Metta, the loving kindness prayer. It starts with sending unconditional love to yourself. Then you send unconditional love to the people that you are closest to and find easiest to love. Then to ones that are maybe a little further out, then further out and more neutral, eventually getting to people you don\u0026rsquo;t love at all. In fact you maybe even hate these people. They get included too. Eventually you get to a place of loving absolutely everyone and every thing. This takes work! It is like a muscle that has to be built up.\nWhen I was staring so fearfully into that mirror back at the workshop I was struggling to get to even the very first step of this prayer. In our society for many of us this is the hardest step. The Dhali Lhama was famously astonished to find this out. He was told that many Buddhist teachers here have people start out the Metta prayer with people they love and then circle back to themselves later on as one of the harder steps. \u0026ldquo;How can you not love yourself!?! It makes no sense!\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nHe is absolutely right of course, but here we are. So many of us are struggling to love ourselves. I’m going to talk about Love in all eight spiral stages before I’m done, but this is the foundational stage. The one where everything else gets built upon. And many of us are struggling with this. We find ourself descending into self hate storms, saying harsh, cutting things to ourself that we never would say to a friend. Climbing out of this self-hate takes so much work! At a HAI workshop I was assisting, one of the attendees exclaimed, “I’ve already done this self love work! I had my big breakthrough! Why is this self hate still coming up for me?!?”. I blinked and told her the hard truth — learning to love yourself is a daily practice that never ends. We have to keep doing it just like we have to keep on doing exercise. We can’t just go on a couple of runs and say we are done with exercise. In exactly the same way we can’t just do a few self compassion workshops and then say we are done with self compassion. Please have patience with yourself. But also please hold out for loving yourself deeply and all the way. Again this is the foundation. Everything gets built on top of this. This is ongoing life long work. We need to come back to this practice over and over.\n"

	"content": "Red is definitely, by far, my weakest stage. I’m still trying to figure out what works best for me to strengthen this. I would very much appreciate suggestions on what to add here. What has worked for you?\nThat said, I do know some things to strengthen Red.\nFace your fears Even to this day sometimes when I come up to the edge of a cliff, I pull back because I have this weird fear that I will impulsively jump off. What was the best way to deal with this fear of heights? Paragliding. There is something about pulling up a paraglider off the ground, turning around and running off a cliff that is amazing. Every time I do it I’m terrified and yet I love soaring free in the air. And the sense of mastery and adventure! I tend to think of warriors as doing the grim difficult thing. And that is definitely a part of it, but oh the joy! The sense of stepping beyond your bounds. The wonder of doing something scary and dangerous but surviving anyways.\nMartial Arts I love to wrestle. I loved wrestling my freshman year in high school. I sometimes go to wrestle parties where I get together with other adults to wrestle with each other. We have two mats. One is the “deep end” of the pool where people can go all out if they want, and the other is the “shallow end” where people are very gentle and playful. It’s great. I particularly like one time a woman came dressed up in a pro wrestler uniform and really let her anger out. The facilitator did a really good job of taking us through that. For many people it is terrifying to see naked, raw anger expressed like that, so the facilitator first made sure that anyone who wasn’t ready to see anger to step away for a bit. Once that was cleared the woman knew it was safe to really vent all the incredible and anger she was feeling. And it was a full body thing — she got to take all that anger and really throw her whole body at a man who could simply receive it. What a beautiful way to do healing.\nIn my Hakomi cohort there was a man who had studied Aikido his whole life. I will never forget what he told me about what this path had taught him. He said that when some throws a punch at you they are trying to narrow down your options. Avoid the punch? Punch back? No matter what you are now in response to what they are doing. But a master of Aikido doesn’t have to fall into reactivity. They don’t have to get mad or scared or have some other kind of big reaction. Instead they can notice that intense energy being sent their way, and simply make a small adjustment to deflect it. The key thing they stay centered and at choice in every moment regardless of what is coming at them. I’m starting pretty late in life on this, but I commit to learning this.\nBDSM I’m not talking dungeons with whips and chains here. That is not what drew me to BDSM. Although if you find a curiosity in yourself about that scene I encourage you to explore it. What I love about the BDSM community is that it cuts through all the bullshit expectations of what is socially acceptable or even normal, and gets straight to the truth of what is alive in us sexually. What turns us on for real. For me I’ve found that there is a real primal charge in domination and submission. That sexual polarity can be so yummy (as long as both partners are in agreement of course). I’ve noticed that my relationships that did not welcome and celebrate that polarity there was no sexual charge. With my ex there was a brief moment where our sexual charge was really hot. The difference? For that brief time we were allowing that polarity. As soon as that polarity went away our sexual charge went as well. By the way, please note when I say “polarity” there are zero gender expectations. What I love about BDSM, at least Bay area BDSM, is that gender norms and expectations go out the window. It doesn’t matter if you present as male, you are allowed to wear corsets and want to be dominated by a Dominatrix. In fact by BDSM standards that is pretty vanilla.\nSo what does this all have to do with Red? Because what we are exploring is the master/slave role. Historically slavery has been such a horrible thing that we quite rightly recoil in horror when we recognize that something about being either the master or slave sparks joy in us. But it does. There is a reason why Red is so persistent and dominant in the world. I needed to stop resisting what I felt like a monster within, and instead accept how much sexual charge there is for me here. And dare I say it there is a real juiciness for some people in the slave role. I found this account by a submissive as really eye opening:\nConquer Me: girl-to-girl wisdom about fulfilling your submissive desires\nShe writes in such an intelligent and thoughtful manner about what it is like for her to fully embrace her submissive desires. It let me see that for some woman my desire to dominate can actually be a gift. This so called monster inside of me, if channeled in the right direction, can be a gift. My current partner loves when I dominate her, and frankly wishes I did it more. It is not her holding us back but me.\n"

	"content": "In the Beige homework section I suggested you start with yourself. In Purple my suggestion is to now start doing this work with others. There is tremendous healing power in groups.\nTrauma Test This is the big one. You almost certainly know on some level if you have had major trauma. What was your childhood like? Were you beaten or abused or maybe simply neglected? Those all can cause deep trauma. Have you been in a situation where people got killed and your own life was at risk? Have you been placed in an impossible situation where you had to do something unspeakable? Or maybe simply you grew up sensitive in a very harsh world. That all alone can cause deep trauma. Please don’t dismiss your trauma as less than others. It all hurts.\nHomework The key thing is to get out of the story that there is nothing you can do. That is so no longer true! There are now lots of ways to treat trauma. Please don’t fall into that same trap the writers of that movie did. We no longer have to just live with our traumas. Please read (or listen to) The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk. This is such an important book. It is the formal announcement that we no longer just have to suffer with trauma like those characters in that movie did. In the second half of this book Bessel talks about all of the different treatments for trauma. One that he is particularly excited about is MDMA talk therapy. This kind of treatment has you (after several initial preparatory talk sessions) do a “heroic” dose of MDMA and then do an extended talk session with a therapist. Please read up on this. If you have severe trauma it is the best treatment that I am aware of. But first I want you to investigate it. This kind of treatment is very close to FDA approval Unfortunately MDMA can be hard on the body so it won’t work for everyone.\nSelf Compassion (in a group) In the Beige homework section I suggested reading Self Compassion; The proven power of being kind to yourself by Kristin Neff. You read it, right? If not, I get it. Books are great, but experiential learning is even better. Actually practicing the material with others is the way to go. Kristin helped set up a worldwide teaching institute for teaching self compassion called the Center for Mindful Self Compassion. They offer both intensive week long retreats as well as an 8 week program. I signed up twice for courses and twice they got cancelled due to Covid so I have not personally yet taken the course. But they look like great courses. So good that I have seriously considered going into their training program so that I can learn to teach the course. Note, if you can, sign up for a course in person. It was astonishing to me how much Zoom could handle during the pandemic, but in this kind of work it so much better to do it in person if you can.\nLoving Kindness Work (others as mirror) In Beige I suggested you take up a mindfulness practice. In the same way I suggest here that you take up a loving kindness practice (Metta). Again this site gives a good overview of the practice:\nhttps://positivepsychology.com/loving-kindness-meditation\nBut I also really encourage you to start looking at others as mirrors. Find where you are resistant to them and get curious. What is it that I’m resisting in them? Do I resist that in myself as well? And then work on loving them. Take turns between looking in the mirror with compassion and then looking at others with compassion. Start to notice how similar this work is.\nFind a Group The heart of Purple is to find a group that welcomes all of you. This is where I have done most of my growth work. Unfortunately there are not nearly as many of these groups around as I would like, and even less when you subtract out the “push” school. My favorite is HAI:\nHuman Awareness Institute If you can just get past that whole taking off your clothes thing, amazing miracles of healing become available. A HAI workshop can be even more powerful than a MDMA session which is saying something.\nIf the naked thing is too much another path is medicine work done in a group. That also can be powerful, but before starting on this work please, please make sure to deal with whatever traumas you have first. It is incredibly dangerous to simply dive into, say, mushrooms without handling that first. And make sure the group takes time to do a proper intention setting before the journey and thorough integration work as a group afterwards. It is during integration that the real benefit of the journey starts to show up.\n"

	"content": "Ok, so now that we have gone through the different aspects of Beige, how do we welcome more of it into the world. What are the practical things we can do? Again this is kind of like an affirmative prayer — the clearer we can visualize this the more likely it is to happen.\nAdvocates Like many kids my daughter was totally thrown off by the pandemic. She was already struggling with school and now she had to do school online? She did it for a while then just stopped. When school opened again she went for awhile and then stopped again. For most of a semester she could not make herself go. Her mom would drive her right up to the school entrance and she couldn’t get out of the car because she was having such a strong anxiety attack. Even though we were going crazy with anxiety of our own we fortunately did not force her. I realized how lucky we were that she was strong enough to say no. Other parents find out how wrong things are when their kids commit suicide, so I was really grateful for that, but it was a hard time. Then we found an amazing school, Holden high school.\nThe transformation in Jaiya has been amazing. She went from a very serious, scary depression to lightness and happiness. She feels supported by the school. She actually enjoys learning again! Not everything of course. Math still is a struggle but I think that is just because unfortunately the standard way of teaching math is broken. And the support for the kids is amazing. The school gives every child a trained, licensed therapist as an advocate. Every kid meets with their advocate at least once a week. It is built into the schedule and there is no stigma attached to it. No special meetings where kids are pulled out of class and everyone looks at them. And the advocate gets to know them better and better throughout the year. They even have a meeting with the parents so they can get a better sense of the family dynamics. Why doesn’t every child have an advocate? When I ask people they usually say how expensive it would be. My question is expensive to what? Compared to all the anxious, depressed kids we have? Compared to the kid that is considering suicide?\nConnection with Nature Some schools like Waldorf know that it is important to connect kids with nature as much as possible. They have kids grow some of the food they eat. They have regular nature outings. These schools have proven that this approach works. Why don’t all schools adopt them? Cost? To paraphrase Biden, show me your budget and I will show you your values. And it wouldn’t even cost that much. Does this sound like just a nice to have? It is mabye OK for poor kids to not get this because other things like trauma prevention are more important? I used to think so too, but Island Wood on Bainbridge Island changed my mind.\nWhen I first toured Island Wood I thought of all the other causes that could have been funded instead with the money lavished on this project. It seemed almost a bit frivolous that had just set up a school in a meadow with all that money. But then I started to understand what an impact this school has on kids. They come from all over Washington state to spend part of a week living at this very nice resort and they learn about nature. But the most important thing is that they are given an opportunity to fall in love with nature. This is such a healing act. It can help with many of our traumas. We once worshipped the Goddess that is our mother earth. We want generations growing up again knowing how much they love the Goddess and how much they are loved by her. So many of us have forgotten. It is time to remember.\nConnection with Body What if we taught kids to love their bodies? The first step is to stop pushing them away from their bodies. Kids naturally love to run, somehow we manage to train them to forget that. What if we instead deepened them into the joy of exercise? Taught them to love pushing their bodies to the limit just for the fun of it. Not because they are going to get a medal or to be better than someone else, but simply because that is what the body longs for. Again, we were literally born to run. And if running is not what a kid wants to do, what about dance? It doesn’t really matter what the exercise is as long as it sparks joy.\nMost schools still do not train kids things like yoga and mindfulness. These are such, basic essential skills! What do you do when you have bad anxiety? You need a way to come back to your body. Things like yoga and mindfulness are great for that. Everyone should know them. But maybe everyone doesn’t know it yet? I remember when I learned to stop hiccuping just by using a form of mindfulness my parents were flatly disbelieving when I told them. I had to show them and even then they were astonished. They were living in the story that stopping hiccups just by mind control was impossible. And they really believed that story. We need to change that story, and the best way is to start with our kids. In fact they instinctively already know most of this, we just have to stop actively taking that away but instead strengthening it.\nAnd there is one more topic that seems to be a big taboo even still — sex. We need to teach kids (and ourselves!) to really embrace our sexuality. There should not be any shame around masturbation. There should not be any shame around sexual desire awakening in us. We need to learn to talk about our sexual organs without embarrassment. Sex is natural and beautiful. And from that place we need to teach kids how to navigate the incredibly strong feeling that come up. Teach them that sex when done right deepens connection with someone else and to be careful about that. People can get really hurt. I remember how alone I felt when my sex drive kicked in. My sexual desire was so intense I honestly begged God for relief — it was just way too much. It felt like a kind of insanity, and maybe it kind of is. And I didn’t have anyone to talk to about it. My drive was so strong I was desperately afraid that it would make me into monster. That I would do almost anything to satisfy it. I needed people (not just men) to talk to about this. But it was such a taboo that I didn’t feel safe talking to anyone. No wonder young men still act out. Is anyone talking to them?\nNext We are almost done with Beige which means… time for homework! What fun! Homework?!?Yaaaaaay!!\n"

	"content": "For each of the stages I am going to ask you to test yourself and then I will suggest homework. For Beige I am going to mainly suggest reading books. If that sounds like too much please consider using audio books. The beauty of audio books is that you can listen to them for 15 minutes in the car while driving somewhere. I got through a couple of the suggested books below that way.\nSelf Compassion Test Hold a handheld mirror away from yourself. Take a deep breath, release tension and then slowly bring the mirror up to your face. Notice what is going on in your body. Is this easy? Is there something going on in your belly? If at any point this gets to be too much it is OK to stop. That just tells you where you are right now. Now if you can bring the mirror to your face and look at yourself. What do you focus on first? A blemish? Something you don’t like? Can you summon love for yourself? Take a moment to really look at yourself. Is this comfortable or uncomfortable. Now say “I love you” into the mirror. How did that land? Did you believe it? Say it again and this time really melt into that love. Love yourself all the way. How did that go?\nHomework Please read this book: Self Compassion; The proven power of being kind to yourself by Kristin Neff. This is a great place to start. She is a leader in this field. For many of us this is the foundation — we have to start here. If this all feels too self indulgent and self centered, please don’t worry — we will address that in later stages. The ultimate goal is to open our heart to everyone not just ourselves. But again I have to emphasize it starts here. Unless and until you can start to deeply love yourself it will be hard to progress. And as I mentioned this is work we have to come back to time and time again. I keep on thinking I have “mastered” this one and then a self hate storm comes up and here I am again all over again starting like a beginner on this work.\nRun (or dance) for Joy Test Where are you with your body? Is there a regular activity that you do that has your heart pumping and your lungs gasping for more air? Is there a regular activity that you do that lets you feel the strength of your muscles? Is there a regular activity you do that focuses you on grace and balance? Are there times when maybe you pushed yourself to do exercise and it made you less willing to do exercise in the future?\nHomework Find physical activities that you love to do and then get into the habit of doing them. Forming good habits is a really good practice in general. I highly recommend it as one the tools you should have in your tool belt. The habit I want you to make is to simply attempt to exercise. Don’t force it if it is not working for you. Then do it in a way that works for your body. It is OK to run slow (maybe very slowly) if that is what you body needs. And if, say, running doesn’t spark joy try something else like maybe ecstatic dance. Trust that your body is craving exercise and find the movement that works for it. Once you have found that, try other exercises as well. You want exercises that span cardio, strength, and grace.\nBut — and I can’t say this enough — don’t do this because it is the right thing to do, do it for the joy. For example, I do Yoga sun salutations most mornings because it is such a great way to start the day. But some mornings I just don’t feel like it so I don’t. Recently I was forcing myself to run with minimalist shoes on pavement. My running technique is not good enough for that and it hurt, but I kept on forcing myself to run anyways. The result? It killed my love for running. I really messed up. It is going to take a while before my body trusts me again. Fortunately I have a long history of joyful runs so it should not be too long before I’m back to running again. But it is a reminder for me to practice what I preach.\n"

Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing in witness to the music and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth. The words started me on the journey but the music they played at church is what got me there. Everything is God. Including me. Including you. Seriously, no-kidding everything.\nEverything means everything I\u0026rsquo;m always a little surprised when I tell people this belief and they just nod and don\u0026rsquo;t push back. There is an awful lot packed into just this one sentence! Following it fully can be quite challenging. Let me give you some examples\nLove your ego I see people arguing earnestly about how important it is to get rid of your ego. I find that alarming. Our ego is an important part of us and it serves us. It is there for a reason. The key is to notice how attached we can get to it and the suffering that can happen when we do. As an aside I confess it is deeply amusing to see people attack the ego in what (at least to me) seems like such an ego-full way.\nLove all the faces of God. Whether you spend two years in a forest monastery or spend two years learning Quantum dynamics in both cases you are devoting yourself to loving one of the faces of God. There are many paths. The way I found my way to spirit was to reassure my rational mind I would never forsake it. It too had an honored path to Truth. It is hard sometimes because I live in two worlds. I live with the Rationalists who don\u0026rsquo;t fully get Spirit. And I live with the Spirit people who quite often don\u0026rsquo;t get Reason and science and don\u0026rsquo;t seem to respect them. There are so many paths to Truth! So many faces of God that I/we don\u0026rsquo;t know yet.\nLove our darkness. Time for confession. During this latest pandemic surge I did the math for how many amongst the vaccine refusers were Trump supporters. I wanted to see if the number of their deaths would change anything politically. The super dark side of this? I was hoping it would. Do you know who else had this kind of mindset? Hitler. All of me is God and deserves love. Even those dark, super scary places? Especially those places. There is no darkness that is in another that is not in me. How could it be?\nWhat I long for But here is the paradox. Yes everything is God, and yet I personally am not OK with much of what is going on. It is like part of this shared consciousness that is Us thinks it is time to wake up and part is resisting and wants to keep on sleeping just a little bit longer. I vow to help people wake up. I think that is what wants to happen, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet exactly how I can be of service.\nForgive me if this all seems too preachy. Please know that I\u0026rsquo;m crying as I write this. As I open myself wider and wider to the All it hurts. There is a lot of joy too of course, but oh the pain! What I want very most is for the world to wake up from this trance of separation and know itself as one. To know that most of this suffering is not necessary. To remember that what our hearts truly long for is to find our way back to the one.\nI love you. Thank you for reading this. I hope it is of use.\n"

	"content": "Why is eight a magic number?\nValence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. When atoms combine into molecules they want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell and if you put two of them together that form a total of eight. I\u0026rsquo;m simplifying a bit of course, but that really is the basic idea. Also it turns out that two in the outer valence shell works as well, but that is not possible for most combinations\nUpper limit to short term memory Our short term memory seems to only hold 5 to 9 things at a time. So if we are coming up with a list that we want people to hold in their heads, eight (or at the very most nine) is the maximum.\nLucky number in China The Chinese hold eight as the luckiest number. They traditionally tended to group all of their important things in eights. So they have eight astrology signs, eight imperial ministers, eight cardinal points, etc. Our western minds are quick to scoff at this, but China has a long, rich lived history that deserves respect.\nNotes in a scale A musical scale has eight notes. When you go up or down by eight notes, the notes somehow sound exactly the same, just at a different octave.\nSweet spot for sleep Eight hours seems to be the sweet spot for hours of sleep\nEight Hakomi Principles Hakomi started with 5 principles, but now (depending on who you ask) is up to 8. I think adding the extra 3 principles really made the list complete. I am very happy about this \u0026ndash; I always thought there were a few missing principles (eg. Loving presence) and now it feels just right to me.\nSpiral Dynamics Spiral Dynamics has 8 levels. Note that just like in chemistry the levels we most want to go to are 2 (Purple) and 8 (Turquoise).\nSo what does all this mean? Nothing really \u0026ndash; I just find it amusing.\n"

	"content": "Backpack without a backpack on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Join us for our first \u0026ldquo;comfy\u0026rdquo; backpacking trip. Experience the magical connection with nature that backpackers get without the need to actually carry a backpack and provisions.\nHow is this possible??\nEach day you get to hike from one campground to the next. Our truck and trailer will transport the gear. At the next camp site your tent and hot meals await you. The hikes each day will last about 6 hours if you are hiking at a moderate pace including time for lunch. On flat stretches they will average 10 miles. On days with elevation gain they are no longer than 6 miles (but you can go longer if you want). On most days there are options for shorter hikes, and you can always ride in the truck if your body is ready for a day off.\nWe have planned a seven day journey into nature starting at the southern tip of the PCT (at the Mexican border). We have found it takes a few days to disconnect from the everyday world and to let yourself really immerse in nature. To accomplish this, we ask that you plan to stay with the group for the whole week. We also ask that you minimize use of cell phones to help keep you in the backpacker\u0026rsquo;s mindset.\nEach afternoon Odysseus will also lead a walk to experience “forest bathing”. This custom originated in Japan and encourages us to use all our senses on a slow walk with stops to appreciate our surroundings.\nYour cost is only the actual cost for camping, supplies and gas. Cost: ~$200 (depending on number of people, max 10) plus your cost to get to and from San Diego. We will provide airport pickup as needed.\nBackpacking without carrying a backpack? Why not!\nDates Saturday, April 16th 2022 - Sunday April 24th 2022\nContact us! Interested but have questions? Ready to sign up? Send one of us an email:\nodysseus.levy@gmail.com rhonda@cayford.org Itinerary We have reserved the campground at Lake Morena starting Saturday (4/16) and you are welcome to join us. Our trip officially starts at the campground at 1pm Sunday April 17. We will do our orientation and then take our first (short) hike.\nDay Date Start End Camp Distance (Options) Day 0, Saturday 4/16 n/a n/a Lake Morena Campground Early arrivals Day 1, Sunday 4/17 Mile 0 Mile 2.4 Lake Morena Campground 2.4 miles Day 2, Monday 4/18 Mile 2.4 Mile 10.9 (+.9) BLM spot 9.4 miles Day 3, Tuesday 4/19 Mile 10.9 Mile 20 Lake Morena Campground 10 miles5.3 miles Day 4, Wednesday 4/20 Mile 20 Mile 32.6 (+.7) Cibbets Flat Campground 13.3 miles7.3 miles3.2 miles Day 5, Thursday 4/21 Mile 32.6 Mile 41.5 Burnt Rancheria Campground 9.6 miles5.5 miles (maybe) Day 6, Friday 4/22 Mile 41.5 Mile 46.2 (+.2) Laguna Campground 5.8 miles2.8 miles Day 7, Saturday 4/23 Laguna Laguna Laguna Campground Your choice; several beautiful loop trails available, 0 - 10 miles Day 8, Sunday 4/24 Laguna Laguna Head home after breakfast (last day) To see a map of the trail go here and zoom in to where the trail starts at the Mexican border.\nFAQ What do I bring? You will need standard camping stuff (tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, flashlight, towels, clothes, etc) plus whatever you need for day hiking (water bottle, daypack). You will need a good hat for the sun, and you will need some warmer clothes for when we get up into the mountains. We will come up with a more complete list closer to the trip.\nWill hot showers be available? Yes! Most of the campgrounds offer showers, and we will also offer outside hot showers from our camper (using a shower tent).\nHow does the food work? We plan on providing most of the food, and then splitting the cost with everyone. We will bring a big, three burner propane cook stove to cook on. We will need help with the cooking and cleaning. If you have special dietary needs you might need to bring some of your own stuff. We will coordinate with people on this.\nWhat happens if the truck breaks down? Except for the first night you will be staying at public campgrounds, so if we have a problem we will be able to get help. The first night is not at a public campground so before we begin the hike, Odysseus will drop off tents, sleeping bags and food there just to be safe. The truck we are using is brand new and quite heavy duty. We don\u0026rsquo;t think we will have problems with it.\nWhy did you choose this part of the PCT? There is something sacred about starting right at the beginning. Year after year people start here with the intent of submitting themselves to great hardship in order to find themselves. I believe that intent blesses the land and makes it special. It took me a little while to adjust to this ecozone, but I have fallen in love with it. I find it surprisingly beautiful. At this time of year we will find desert flowers blooming and Spring waterfalls flowing. Once we get up to the Laguna mountains the views are incredible.\n"

	"content": "Next Hopefully I have convinced you that Spiral Dynamics is a useful story. But how does it help us? How do we work more skillfully with all the stages? Let\u0026rsquo;s take one more spin through all the stages to consider what needs to be done.\nBeige So many people are collapsed down to the survival level. They are leading quiet lives of desperation. Just barely able to make it each day. Sometimes this is because they are brutally poor. Sometimes because they are refugees of famine or war. And in the U.S an unbelievably high number of people are trauma victims. People are so traumatized that they can barely lead their lives. This is common! We have to stop this. We should spend at least as much money on defense of our children as we do on military defense. We are all wounded and this collective pain is holding us back. We must heal first. And we do that by finding our way back to our bodies and the land.\nPurple Very few people are at authentic Purple. We have done much too good a job of conquering the world to let them survive. So our goal here is to simply learn. Purple has a lot to teach us. In fact it already has. Native American (Purple) intellectuals had a huge affect on American society. Feeling skeptical about that? Please read this book: The Dawn of Everything. An anthropologist and archaeologist teamed up to do the careful, painstaking scholarship needed to completely upend the existing myths about early societies. It turns out that Purple societies lived in large egalitarian cities for thousands of years. They used clever, sustainable agriculture that did not require excessive amounts of labor. And they knew all about Red, and consciously chose systems of government to prevent the empire of Red from arising. They had learned from hard experience what was necessary to lead free and full lives. This is what the Native American intellectuals had to teach the settlers. But the settlers only took part of the message. We all have much more to learn.\nRed I think the main thing is to recognize that Red is in fact a stage. We have to meet these people where they are at, not where we wish they were. And we have a lot of work to do. Other generations have made this work their main focus, and they made huge progress. They built a solid Blue that gave Red something worthwhile to transition to. Unfortunately we have mostly let that Blue collapse and now we are going to have to rebuild. Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe the Blue of old with all its patriarchy and racism needed to die so we can recreate something better. But again we have some serious work to do. The main challenge we face with people at Red is to get them to open up to a Truth bigger than themselves. How do we do that? We connect them to their deeper, spiritual nature. The knowing that there is something much, much bigger than just themselves. And how do we do that? We need new religions. Religions that work for all the stages. Religions that work even if you are an militant atheist (Orange) or deeply skeptical of hierarchy (Green). Religions gentle enough that they work for all the spiritually abused people, but powerful enough that people can experience true transformation. People have been working on this. I think there are some candidates we can look at.\nWe also have forgotten how to live together in community. We need to become a nation of joiners again. Like we were before the great Blue collapse starting in the 70\u0026rsquo;s. Kids need to belong to something that teaches them that sacrificing for the group is sometimes really important. We need to get kids out into nature together and aspiring to something higher. Grown ups need to belong to organizations that encourage everyone to take a turn at leading. And ultimately we want people joining groups that are dedicated to saving the world.\nBlue Again, Blue seems to be in pretty steep decline in the U.S. That is partly because, outside of the Mormons, the only religions not in total collapse are the Red evangelical churches. But this collapse is also partly because we are actually quite good at converting people from Blue to Orange. How are we doing that? College. A good college education teaches people critical thinking skills. Whereas a technical school teaches people practical skills, college teaches people how to think. Someone who is college educated sees the world differently. Unfortunately, college is tied up with class dynamics and money. If you want to be part of the upper class you need to go to college. It should not be like that. Instead, college should be available for everyone, even those not naturally good at school. And maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to college right after high school. Not everyone relishes the thought of four more years of school. Fine, let\u0026rsquo;s have technical and trade schools to prepare those people for jobs that pay well and are respected. But let\u0026rsquo;s not give up on people later wanting to go to college. People should have the right to those four extra years of higher education whenever they want it no matter how old they are. We want to give everyone the opportunity to become college educated not because it will help them earn more but because it will transform them.\nWe also need to transform the way we teach kids. Maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until college to teach them critical thinking. My daughter was struggling in high school and needed a lot of help from me to get through her homework. So I got a pretty good idea of what her curriculum was, and I was not impressed. In particular the science curriculum was really bad. It started out introducing scientists that were not white or male (Green). That really worked for her and I thought that part was great. What didn\u0026rsquo;t work is how boring the class was after that promising beginning. The mysteries of the universe are revealed and somehow they are made boring? What a waste. But I don\u0026rsquo;t even really care what science facts my daughter learns as long as she is taught how to think like a scientist does. How do we know something is True? In science we have a definite path. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice if more people knew how to follow this path. We are not teaching that. We also need to stop using math as a torture device. In college I worked in a math lab to help people with whatever math problems they were having. I quickly realized I was a math therapist not a tutor. Students almost inevitably first had to work through their horrible math traumas before they could move forward. Get past that math teacher belittling them and throwing the eraser at them. The students had taken on the belief that they could not do math. This is so not right. We all have math brains. If I were a math teacher I would have the kids start each class with a short affirmation that they have math brains. This weird story we tell ourselves that only some people \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; math is just that \u0026ndash; a story. The truth is that math and scientific thinking are available to all of us. But we need better teaching to get us there.\nOrange I admire the first communist revolutionaries. They courageously stood up against the (Orange) enslaving capitalists. It was a brutal time and this fight was very necessary. Many of the first communist revolutionaries were killed or cruelly suppressed. But they dared to dream a much bigger dream than before. And they changed the story. We don\u0026rsquo;t give them proper credit, but these revolutionaries drastically changed our governments for the better. We all ended up becoming socialists. We still struggle with this but even the Trump could not over turn (mildly) socialist healthcare, and they certainly could not touch Social Security.\nCapitalism has a lot to answer for. Wealth inequality is higher than it has ever been and continues to get worse. Capitalists proudly point at poverty rates going down throughout the world but it was bought at the cost of ecological devastation. Wild areas are dwindling. Oil companies continue to make huge profits as we hurtle towards climate disaster. The natural world is seen as just a resource, a thing that can be extracted and used. A thing that is somehow separate from us. We have severed our relationships with the natural world and we suffer for it. So I find calls for a sacred economy very compelling.\nBut consider Elon Musk. He is a really good example of Orange. He obviously understands science, but there are serious, credible, multiple allegations of over the top racism at his Tesla factory, and there also have been very concerning reports of sexual harassment as well. So classic Orange \u0026ndash; he is clearly not at Green. And this is not acceptable. He also it has to be said is a bit of a nut. But consider the contributions his companies have made. Tesla has propelled the electric car from this wildly improbable notion to accepted, inevitable reality. His space company is spreading internet connections to even the most isolated people. His solar company pioneered an innovative financing program that lets people put solar on their house without having to pay for it all up front, and it also is leading the way in installing batteries into people\u0026rsquo;s homes. Oh and yes, he is bound and determined to set up a city of a million people on Mars. That probably should not be our highest priority, but please don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate the power of this dream. People crave meaning and purpose, and this crazy Mars dream provides it. It also probably is what has made him so successful \u0026ndash; he has called together people willing to sacrifice for this bigger dream. We would become as Gods!\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced capitalism is all bad. There are parts of it that are working. I think we need this stage just like we need Red. The trick is to harness it and point it in the right direction. You are a new billionaire? Great! Now please realize that over 95% of your estate will be taxed so you might as well point your capitalistic brilliance to giving your money away. Bill Gates retired from Microsoft at a relatively early age and with his then wife set up the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. The goal was to give away most of their money in the most effective way possible. Bill and Melinda repeatedly called on other billionaires to do the same, and they managed to convince some others like Warren Buffet to join with them. They used their business skills to find causes that would provide the best social return for the investment. One vast sweeping goal they settled early on was to completely eradicate malaria. Malaria was a poor person\u0026rsquo;s disease and was just not a priority at the time. And yet it causes immense suffering in the world. So they got to work. Over the last twenty years, serious progress has been made and millions of lives have been saved. There is now an effective malaria vaccine available. Bill and Melinda made this possible\nBut we obviously don\u0026rsquo;t want people to stay at this level. We want them to open their hearts to the bigger suffering. We want them to understand that we are trapped in a culture of racism and patriarchy, and that we desperately need to reconnect to the nurturing earth. But some people no matter how smart they are seem very stuck at this stage. Even a spiritual awakening does not appear to be enough. How do we get them to open theWe want them to open their minds to more than just science and reason. Up until now Green has done a reasonably good job of encouraging Orange people to make the transition to Green. But recently it seems like Green\u0026rsquo;s very understandable anger is pushing Orange away. Anger is necessary and in this case even sacred, but we have to learn to use it skillfully.\nGreen The problem with Green is that it is prone to staying in victim. It gets caught up in group think and endless purity tests. And people tend to stay small. They wait for the Great Leader to guide the way, not realizing that they themselves can be that leader. When Green first appeared we made great leaps forward, but recently progress has slowed and in some areas we\u0026rsquo;re even heading backwards. We need people to go deeper now. We need people to dive all the way into themselves and find their authentic self. And when they come back up for air they will be at Yellow.\nFinding our full Truth is scary. This path requires courage. If we have unprocessed trauma we need to first address it in our Healing Up work. If the trauma is too raw there is too much pain to do much else so this has to be handled first. We need to learn to deeply love ourselves despite all our imperfections. That creates the safety needed to go even deeper. To find out more of our Truth. What is holding us back is that certain things are too dangerous to know. It would hurt too much to know. So our protector parts conspire to hide us from our full truth. Those parts are working hard to protect us. So we can\u0026rsquo;t just jump straight all the way in. We have to take baby steps. Dip a little deeper into the Truth, pause to find compassion for ourselves and integrate this new understanding. And then keep on dipping a little further. At some point we realize that instead of looking for others to their Truth we now find it inside ourself. We now stand accountable to ourselves. Welcome to Yellow.\nYellow I am privileged to know a lot of Yellow stage people. They are all amazing and making the world a better place. The problem is they have done such a good job of grounding in their inner Truth that they lose touch with the need for groups. In moving away from Green we learn to reject group think and instead learn to find the answers within. This is so important and necessary. And we need many more people at this stage. Yet even this stage is not enough. We need something even bigger. When I try to talk about saving the world to Yellow people they tend to focus on what impact they personally can make. And that part is super important \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t get there without all of these wise, individual contributions. But by itself it is not enough. Once we find that strength within we also need to see how we fit into the bigger picture. We need to once again come back to the group.\nI am not yet certain I have figured out how to move Yellow to Turquoise. I am only on the initial steps myself. But for me it was about fully accepting how we are not separate. How your joy is my joy and your pain is my pain. We are one. And when I open up to that bigger Truth, the pain of the world rushes in. I want to flee. The trick here is to remember I am vast. That I am even bigger than that tidal wave of pain. And then I can sit with it. Accept it and embrace it. But oh my goodness does it hurt. And as I sit with that immense pain, I know that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. We, together, can join to shift this. But we need so many more people here. As many as we can get. And I look out and dream a wild dream. I dream that you too will find the strength to sit with the pain of the world. And that you too will then look out towards others and ask, \u0026ldquo;What is our plan? How are we going to do this together?\u0026rdquo; Welcome to Turquoise.\nTurquoise This stage is where we finally find our way back to what we knew at Purple. We burned our bridges at Red and no longer could go back. We had to keep on pushing forward through Blue, Orange, Green, and Yellow before we finally could make it home again. Yellow understands all the stages and can effectively work with them, but Turquoise whole heartedly loves and embraces all that we are. Revels in both our light and dark. This is what wants to happen if only we can get out of our own way. I think the very first step is to hold in our hearts that this huge dream is possible. That it is mainly our fears and habits that are holding us back. We forget how huge we are. It is time to remember.\nTurquoise will be beautiful. People will go back to a full freedom they have not had for a very long time. We will once again live in sacred harmony with the land. Forests and rivers will stop being just resources to extract and will again be holy land. Our land helps feed us, yes, but also nourishes our soul. Children will run free and be loved by the whole village. We will help each of them find their reason for coming to Earth. Elders will achieve a certain wisdom and mentor the younger generations. No more traumas passed from generation to generation. No more genocide. No more senseless wars. This is possible. It truly is. But not if we continue as we are. We need a plan, a really huge, sweeping dream of a plan. And once more I ask you. Will you join me? I think I really do know what I am asking of you. Please join me anyways.\n"

	"content": "collection of snippets Missing Loving Presence principle Love is scary, so we hold back. From the very first weekend of my Hakomi trainings we were taught to create a loving bubble with our client. If we could not find a way to love them it was suggested they should maybe not even be our client. So clearly Hakomi is grounded first and foremost in Love but it was not yet one of the principles. Which made no sense. I made a point of privately asking every teacher why Love was not one of the principles and every one of them kind of blinked in surprise and said \u0026ndash; it should be! They couldn\u0026rsquo;t really explain why it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, but I think I know. It turns out that I am not the only one who thought that if you caress someone\u0026rsquo;s face and look deeply into their eyes that that means sex has to happen next. Therapists are taught to hold a certain separation from their client and to expect their clients to project all sorts of things onto them. Therapists fear that they will break down and maybe take advantage of their client\u0026rsquo;s hunger for love and validation. It happens all too often.\nDifferent healing paths So how do we teach people to find their pbody? It has to be experiential. People need to experience it in their bodies to truly understand it. But it won\u0026rsquo;t be just one method. Different approaches will work best for different people. For example, HAI does a fantastic job of getting people in intimate relationship with their body, but for many people getting naked in front of a group of strangers is just a non-starter. There is simply no way they are going to sign up for that. Similarly a sacred MDMA or mushroom journey can offer incredibly healing, but again for many people that kind of journey is way too scary. So we have to meet people where they are at. We will have to make sure that for each person we find things that helps them with diet, movement, sex, and substance abuse. Each person will have something tailored for them, and it will be part of an integrated plan \u0026ndash; not something that is held separate. Because all of our work is connected. We might think that maybe we just need to work on, for example, our relationship with our partner, but that is an illusion. As you work on that relationship you are also working on everything else. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body.\nHealing Just like that. The first step is quite pleasant \u0026ndash; learn to find a deep joy inside yourself. Deepen enough into that joy and you might find yourself surfacing back up into a world where we are truly one. Were your pain is mine and I can no longer ignore it. As I learn to love you, I learn to love myself. From that place miracles happen.\nHakomi Body-Centered Psychotherapy\nOld paradigm New paradigm fundamental separateness unbroken wholeness\nfundamental connectedness absolute certitude\nonly matter is real (materialism) uncertainty, relativity\nconsciosness is real (dualistm, monism) the mind/body split mind/body integration biology is destingy we create our own destiny Goal My goal is to first save the world, because it needs saving. If we don\u0026rsquo;t stop carbon dioxide emissions soon, billions will die. But we have to go way beyond just that because in some ways it already is too late. Climate change is now irreversible. There is no going back. We are going to have to learn to share a very different, challenging world. Simply to survive we now have no choice but to learn to care for all. Some will live in areas that benefit from climate change and many will not. We will have to learn to share everything. But this urgent necessity is also an opportunity. We can chose to create a world of our dreams. It really is possible. In fact it is our best hope of survival. I hope to convince you to join me. I need allies. This world needs allies.\nThis site is meant for people who are excited by the bigger dream of what we are all collectively waking up to. Waking up to finding their bigger purpose of service. Service coming not from a place of self-sacrifice but instead from listening to the call for the deeper joy that is struggling to be born but needs some midwives. Please join me. I can\u0026rsquo;t do this alone.\nSo many people are already working on saving the world. But often they are only bringing just a part of themselves to the work. Many people are doing great science (Mind) based work and wondering why people are not moved by what they have discovered. They are not meeting people where they are. Many people are doing the intense healing (Body) work that is so needed, but are not aware of how they fit into the bigger picture. We need people to step into a larger world view. Many people are doing the profound (Heart) work of loving themselves and the world. But they are learning to endure the unendurable. We need them to come back from their lofty heights and join the work.\nFor example, the Prosperity Gospel is a very Red mindset.\nWe wil regain the three primoridal freedoms:\nFreedom to move Freedom to disobey Freedom to create or transform social relationships But that is going to take time. The great spiritual awakenings led by Jesus and Mohammed took many decades before they reached critical mass. What do we do in the meantime? Again we need to meet people where they are at. Recognize that they think differently than people at other stages. And in the U.S. it would help if we acknowledge the betrayal of the working class. There is a reason for all that anger. There is a reason why so many people in Trump counties are dying of despair. There is a class war going on and the lower classes are losing badly. Most college educated people I know came from comfortable middle class backgrounds and they have a huge blindspot here. They can\u0026rsquo;t understand why people don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;vote their interest\u0026rdquo;. Why do people vote against politicians who would give them more money? They don\u0026rsquo;t understand that most working class people don\u0026rsquo;t want to depend on government handouts, they simply want a good job that their families can depend on. A job that won\u0026rsquo;t get shipped overseas like all the others. Something they can be proud of, and feel like they are an important, contributing member of society. And people are willing to rally around this. When Trump imposed harsh (and seemingly arbitrary) tariffs on China, that policy was popular with his base. Red farmers were willing to sacrifice in solidarity with their factory brothers. Unless and until Democrats address this class divide I don\u0026rsquo;t see things getter any better.\nYellow groups How do we help people do that? This is the work of Wising Up. Here are the wising up paths that I know to work. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are many more:\nMedicine Work Soulcraft Personal growth courses (eg. HAI) Again, I think Michael Polan\u0026rsquo;s How to Change Your Mind is a fantastic resource for Green yearning for Yellow. He was open to this work because he understood that maybe just maybe there is more to this world than the rational parts of our brain can comprehend. That is very Green. And then when he experienced amazing journeys into himself he took his first steps into Yellow.\nMedicine work is a great path but it is not the only way. Bill Plotkin\u0026rsquo;s Soulcraft brings back the Purple vision quest to our own day and age. It sounds amazing. People do several days of preparation and then head into the wilderness alone for up to four days to find themselves. When they come back out they are transformed. They see the world in a new light. What a great way to bring people to Yellow. I have not (yet) done one, but Forest Therapy was inspired by this kind of vision quest work.\nAny group that encourages people to look deeply and courageously inside themselves can work. For example, when I did my two years of Hakomi training we learned how to do Hakomi style therapy, but we also went deep into ourselves. We learned how to stand up in the world in a much more grounded, authentic way. And my work at HAI changed my life. I will talk more about this in the next section.\nOrange to Green But we obviously don\u0026rsquo;t want people to stay at this stage if possible. And we actually have a pretty good mechanism to get people from Orange to Green - a modern liberal arts education. The difference between just a college education and a modern liberal arts education is that the modern liberal arts education asks you to examine the deeper questions. It builds upon the base of critical thinking (Orange) and uses that critical thinking to show you how limited that base is. The problem we face with Orange is getting it to understand that not everything is as crisp and clean as a mathematical proof. That reason is not the only source of Truth. That we are firmly embedded in culture and many of our \u0026ldquo;Truths\u0026rdquo; are just cultural stories. Green actually does a great job of this \u0026ndash; there are lots and lots of resources here. We just need to make it accessible. Drop the pretension and enormous cost and make this education available to everyone whenever they are ready. Maybe they are not ready right out of highschool? Again, that is pretty common. Again, let\u0026rsquo;s let them take those four years whenever it works for them no matter how old.\nTowards Turqoise Spiral Dynamics gives us a better story. It helps us put into context all that has happened. We can step out of helpless victim and into problem solving mode. We see all the stages and recognize both their shadows and gifts. It breaks down the big problem into more manageable chunks. It offers us a path to follow. How do we save the world? One way is to help people move into higher and higher stages. And how do we do that? The First tier stages (everything before Yellow) have historical precedents for how to move people to the next level. But we don\u0026rsquo;t have that for Yellow. Getting people to Yellow and then helping them deepen into it has to be one of our top priorities. But I have to confess to an even bigger dream \u0026ndash; getting Yellow to Turqoise.\nAgain, I am assuming that you are at Yellow and are committed to deepening into that work. You are not alone. Yellow is now well enough established that we can start to pull together some of the different schools and start to notice how much they share. Because you are Yellow, you more than most really get that there can\u0026rsquo;t be just One True Way, but instead you will have to find the way that works for you. That said, there are some things that I wish I had been told. Things that would have\nThe end goal is to get people up to Turqoise. Or at the very least help people deepen into their Yellow practice. We do that by getting people to truly love and embrace all the color stagesBefore we can fully step into the full solution we need to do these other steps as well. And just like Turquoisespirals back to Purple, Showing Up spirals back to Turquoise. We will find our way back to Growing Up but at a different level.\nTowards Yellow Each stage had some organization that pulled people into it. What is pulling people into Yellow? The biggest pull right now is from Medicine (psychedelics) work. There are many paths that can lead to a Yellow awakening, but the most popular seems to be Medicine work. If you choose to do this work, please be sure to do it with a reputable, trained guide who is part of a community that holds high ethical standards. And please read How to Change Your Mind. Michael Pollan (presumably without knowing about Spiral Dynamics) does a superb job of explaining to people mostly at the Green stage what it is like to explore Yellow. People who are still at Orange are not ready to go straight to Yellow because their god of Reason is a jealous god that will not accept any other sources of Truth. But at Green people start to get a glimmer that there are other paths to Truth and maybe just maybe Medicine is something worth investigating as a path of growth not just healing.\nCleaning up Let\u0026rsquo;s start Cleaning Up by visiting the stink spirit video from Spirited Away again. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched it yet please consider watching it now.\nWe all have a lifetime of accumulated junk that is keeping us from our true shining nature. Notice how much courage and fortitude is needed just to get started. It feels kind of hopeless. I\u0026rsquo;m not worth the effort! But there was curiousity \u0026ndash; I wonder what Sen is going to do? Ask for help? And then we get that first precious bath of healing medicine and something starts to shift. We still are very much stuck in our \u0026ldquo;stink\u0026rdquo;, but possibilities start to open up. Huh. I see a bicycle handle sticking out. Let\u0026rsquo;s try pulling it out. Wait. We need to rally the whole community for this one. Pull! So much junk! And at the very end Sen is left with the gift of a medicine ball in her hand. When we find out true nature we also find our gift.\nYet to be Explored Vision quests Art therapy Better Theory. We now have a theory called Integral theory that brings in all of us not just our western, rational minds. It welcomes the scientist as well as the Buddhist, and it suggests a hopeful path of what wants to happen next. Better Therapy. We are now seeing proven, effective treatments for even people suffering with severe trauma. We\u0026rsquo;ve never had that before. Hurt people hurt people. If we can stop the cycle of suffering passed from one generation to the next that alone would dramatically change the world for the better. Practical spirituality. One of the therapy treatments for trauma is the use of Psychedelics. This Medicine work also opens up access to spiritual states that previously only the most driven and dedicated could get to. And now they are in the reach of everyone. Peoples hearts fling wide open when they get to these states. Civil War Let me start with a simple question. Why do we think the Civil War actually solved anything? Did that war really change hearts and minds? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Not really. Imagine the end of the U.S. Civil War. The North has just crushed the South using brutal, total war: Sherman\u0026rsquo;s March to the Sea. The South surrenders with the bitter realization that the North will stop at absolutely no unspeakable atrocity in order to totally crush them. And that truly may have been the only way to end the war. Imagine though that you are a slave owner that now has to free their slaves. Do you really awaken to your evil wickedness and acknowledge that the North was right all along? Of course you don\u0026rsquo;t. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to have sympathy at this point for the slave owner, but what about their children? Maybe you can find sympathy for them? They are growing up in a culture that teaches them a certain mindset. Why do we think that mindset would magically change? It didn\u0026rsquo;t of course. Within twenty years after the war, Southern whites had regrouped and replaced the old system of slavery with a new form of economic slavery called share cropping. Yes, still better than actual slavery, but Blacks could not vote and still lived in oppression. This is the Authoritarian mindset. Why do we think that somehow this changes? How does that even work? So of course there is ongoing, systemic racism in the U.S.\nThose people proudly waving confederate flags carry almost the exact mindset of their ancestors. They are not stupid, they know exactly what they are celebrating, but they also don\u0026rsquo;t consider themselves evil. We do of course, but they definitely don\u0026rsquo;t. Interesting. OK, let\u0026rsquo;s take one more step back. How did slavery even become a thing? It turns out that throughout history slavery was pretty common. Greece and Rome were slave empires. In a very real way the Authoritarian mindset of the Roman empire is still very much alive. Just look at all those people waving that damn flag.\nSo how do we deal with this reality? Yes, completely unacceptable, but here we are. Calling people stupid and evil has not proven to be an effective method. In fact it can often make things worse \u0026ndash; people harden in their opposition. And once we get past stupid and evil as the easy, lazy explanations for people\u0026rsquo;s behavior we can start to really understand them. And it is not just them. There are many mindsets operating in the world, not just Authoritarians. How do we navigate this? We need a map.\nClimate change In some ways we are already too late. We already have launched irreversible climate change. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we are necessarily doomed, especially if we can rally to halt emissions in time. But it does mean that we are going to have to learn to cooperate in a way we have not before. Places that used to produce food will likely become barren with drought. But places that used to be too cold to grow food will suddenly become productive farmlands. This is already happening. The world is going to be a dif want to go much further than just that\nDespair to Hope It is a pretty wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance it will require many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths to Truth, let me first start with mine.\nSave the World When I let my heart open wider and wider into the vastness of all that is, I find pain. So. much. pain! Can you feel it also? At least a little? The sensitives among us certainly do. Here take this pill so you can function, as if shock and horror were not the most appropriate reaction to the world. As if everything is fine, just keep on going don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to that homeless person huddled miserably in the corner. And our history! Generation after generation passing its trauma on to the next. So many people growing up in hurt and lack. It hurts so much! The pain can feel like an immense, implacable ocean wave sweeping me away from the security of shore. Better, safer to hide away.\nAnd we are on a deadline. Global warming looks to be worse than scientists feared. If we don\u0026rsquo;t take drastic action billions may die. Yet most people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to really get how urgent the problem is. Don\u0026rsquo;t seem to realize it for the existential threat that it is. My daughter asks me if it will be OK for her to have children in the future, and I have to stop and really think about it. What kind of world will her children live in? What evidence do I have that things are going to get better?\nIt is easy to give in to hopelessness. What can any one person really do in the face of the relentless forces shaping the world? People are going to suffer, and yes it is probably going to get much worse. We can do our best, but it probably won\u0026rsquo;t be enough. It is hopeless.\nAnd yet.\nStop and breath, and know.\nThere is hope. Always.\nEven in the depths of horrific trauma there can be moments when all that pain cracks something open and lets Grace shine through. When despite it all we recognize the beauty and glory of simply being alive in this imperfect world and are profoundly grateful. Mixed with the filth there is also beauty, glory, and awe. All wrapped up together. There is no deeper joy without the deeper suffering.\nAnd again I say there is hope. Please try to let that in, if only a little. It is what I want very most for this world to know.\nKnow that you are not alone. Brilliant people the world over have been working on this problem. And they have come up with all sorts of useful ideas and practices. I wish more people knew about them. With these advances we will change the world:\nSave The World (first try) I love movies where the reluctant heroes are desperately trying to save the world against what seem impossible odds. First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.\nPolice kill black men seemingly at will. Large parts of the population seem to be indifferent to the needless deaths and suffering of a million people. And it gets worse. Global warming is here and we are burning. Species are dying in numbers we can barely comprehend. In our children\u0026rsquo;s lifetimes it is possible large parts of the planet might become uninhabitable. If we don\u0026rsquo;t make drastic changes, it is possible that billions of people will die. Seriously.\nStill with me? I don\u0026rsquo;t blame you if your first instinct is to stop reading. If you let yourself really consider how bad things could get it is just too overwhelming. Billions of people dying? Surely that is hysterical hyperbole? It is just too much. Sadly it is a real possibility.\nThere is Hope But please know this. There is hope. Really and truly. It is not going to be easy of course. It never is in dire situations like this. And unlike the movies there is no guarantee that everything will work out in the end. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be writing this if I did not truly believe there is hope.\nAgain it is not going to be easy. No heroic journey ever is. Are you willing to at least start? The very first step is to embrace the pain. Really let yourself feel how awful this is. Yuck! Why would you want to do that? Because with pain comes a precious gift \u0026ndash; the energy to do whatever it takes to get out of that pain. The bigger the pain the bigger the gift that comes with it. Think about times in your life when something hurt so bad that you just had to make a drastic change. That pain gave you the energy to make a change you might not have made otherwise. It is exactly like that but on a global scale.\nWe are going to need this gift of energy because we are about to embark on a heroic journey.\nReady to begin?\nTrump During the Trump presidency it felt like political commentators were crashing around their bedroom at night trying to get to the bathroom. Not really recognizing what they were bumping into. For example many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed him as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of Authoritarian governments in the world recently. Others only focused on recent events without realizing that this is an age old problem. It turns out that it is rare for a democracy to not succumb to Authoritarianism collapse at some point. And even more failed to recognize that this authoritarian mindset has been with us from the very beginnings of recorded history.\nWe need to stop and take the time to turn on the light and see where we are. What exactly are we bumping into? We see this Authoritarian mindset, are there other mindsets that are also driving the world? We need a map. If we truly want to succeed in winning hearts and minds we need to meet people where they actually are not where we think they should be. In my experience telling people that they are stupid and evil just has not been an effective way to get them to change. Have you had a different experience? This is where theory and models can help. We need a better understanding of why people do what they do. We need to bring our thinking minds in and go much deeper than we have.\nLater on I\u0026rsquo;m going to introduce a theory called Spiral Dynamics which has a very powerful explanation for much that we see in the world. It lets us understand people without resorting to just calling them stupid and evil. But right here I want to focus on the need for some theory period. Here are a few examples of questions any theory we adopt would have to help us answer:\nMy waking up I want people to end up where I am. How did I get to this point? I found a number of wise schools to guide me. I was asked to seriously commit to a rich, deeply fulfilling life. And I did. I now awaken each morning to joy. Then I was taught to find something bigger than myself, and then finally I woke up to what I am called to do. This is a powerful path to walk. Please walk with me.\nMindfulness from truth So all of these schools are working to get people to their deeper Truth. Get them past whatever is blocking them from getting there. Without ever explicitly mentioning it they also are teaching people to get into the habit of always checking inside for their Truth. To get in the habit of paying attention to what is going on inside. Encouraging them to take frequent pauses to check in with themselves. There is a name for this practice \u0026ndash; it is call mindfulness. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about that next.\nThirty years For thirty years I have done nothing. Back in the 90\u0026rsquo;s environmentalists knew a disaster was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the scientists kept on coming back to report that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The reports got so bad I could not make myself read them. It hurt too much. If you read them carefully, you can hear the scientists screaming in anguish. And I still did nothing.\nNo longer.\nI will not do nothing for another thirty years. I have been waiting for someone else to take care of it. That hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked The world needs someone even as ordinary as me. No matter how hard it gets I can not imagine anything more painful than confessing to my grandchildren thirty years from now that yet again I stood by and did nothing.\nJoy Just about every morning I find myself in joy. A place of deep, sometimes even overwhelming happiness. It is hard to let it all in. Some days I go straight there, other days it takes a bit of processing, but I end up there never the less. And when I\u0026rsquo;m in that joy I find myself longing for others to join me. I long for the world to heal. It is what I want very\n"
