      <description>Growing up we absolutely did not talk about masturbation. It was shameful and wrong. The surgeon general, Dr Joycelyn Elders was promptly fired when she said that masturbation was healthy, normal, and should be taught in school. No one questioned Clinton getting rid of her — of course she had to be fired!&#xA;So let’s talk about masturbation.&#xA;First of all, what a beautiful even potentially sacred act of self love. I don’t always treat it like that of course. Quite often it is just a simple body comfort and I do it watching porn. But I also have a conscious masturbation practice. I think everyone should.</description>

      <description>Buddhists have a process called RAIN that can get you unblocked and back into healing and growth. It turns out that Hakomi uses almost the exact same process, but they go a few steps further. I’ve tacked ING onto the end to address that. Note that I’m not quite exactly getting the Hakomi extra steps right, but at least it is the gist of it. And I do dearly love the cuteness of the expanded acronym.</description>

      <title>Everything is God</title>

      <description>Everything is God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is love&#34;&#xA;Does this ring true to you? It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing in witness to the music and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth. The words started me on the journey but the music they played at church is what got me there. Everything is God. Including me. Including you. Seriously, no-kidding everything.</description>

      <title>Ugly</title>

      <description>It is incredibly hard to be ugly. This pain of it is not really acknowledged in our society. Having at least reasonable looks is a privilege. I spent much of my life as ugly and it was really hard. My mother told me over and over that I was very attractive. But when my sister was having a fancy wedding, I got a call from both my mom and my sister to make sure that I would be OK with getting serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures were taken. This was clearly really, really important to them. Oh. So that is the truth. The makeup artist proceeded to plaster on as much makeup as you would do for a stage performer. To the makeup artist’s credit I think it did really help. I’m sure my mom thought it was important to hide the truth from me, but it didn’t really help me. I really had a serious problem and pretending that I didn’t (until it was time to take wedding pictures) wasn’t helping any. I needed plastic surgery.</description>

      <title>Eight is a magic number (tangent)</title>

      <description>Why is eight a magic number?&#xA;Valence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. When atoms combine into molecules they want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell and if you put two of them together that form a total of eight. I’m simplifying a bit of course, but that really is the basic idea. Also it turns out that two in the outer valence shell works as well, but that is not possible for most combinations</description>

      <title>2022 Hike the Pacific Crest Trail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pct-trip/index.html</link>

      <description>Backpack without a backpack on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Join us for our first “comfy” backpacking trip. Experience the magical connection with nature that backpackers get without the need to actually carry a backpack and provisions.&#xA;How is this possible??&#xA;Each day you get to hike from one campground to the next. Our truck and trailer will transport the gear. At the next camp site your tent and hot meals await you. The hikes each day will last about 6 hours if you are hiking at a moderate pace including time for lunch. On flat stretches they will average 10 miles. On days with elevation gain they are no longer than 6 miles (but you can go longer if you want). On most days there are options for shorter hikes, and you can always ride in the truck if your body is ready for a day off.</description>

      <description>I’m curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.&#xA;Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.</description>
