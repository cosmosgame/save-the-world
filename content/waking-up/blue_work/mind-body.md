As I deepened into my spiritual awakening it felt so amazing that I wanted to share.  I wanted others to also find this place of joy inside themselves. But how? Religion works for some, but not for many others. We need something else.  And then I did my first guided mushroom trip. Yes. This.  Spirit is something you have to actually experience.  Feel it in your beating heart that we are not lonely, separate beings making our sad way through life. Feel it in your bones that we are one and that love is an ocean waiting, begging to be let in. Not just pretty words living just in your head, but as much a part of you as your skin.

And when you really feel it all the way, then the thing that wants to happen, organicity, just flows. Back to that now.
