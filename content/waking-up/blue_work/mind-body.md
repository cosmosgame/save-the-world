The scientist in her got to watch in fascination as the impact of the stroke made itself known. What surprised her the most was the profound sense of peace and euphoria she experienced. Instead of feeling panic or fear, she was surprised to find herself immersed in a state of bliss and tranquility. This was due to the parts of her brain that focus on the present moment, interconnectedness, and holistic perception became dominant. She felt a deep sense of unity with the universe and a release from the worries and stresses because those parts of her brain that managed all that were no longer online. This unexpected experience of peace and spiritual connection was a revelation for her, as it contrasted so sharply with her prior understanding of the brain's functions.

In her book she attributes a lot of this to the right brain/left brain dichotomy. But it turns out that might be a vast oversimplification, and it really isn’t necessary. What is important (and non controversial) is that there are parts of our brain that special in certain functions. When 

Please note that the left brain/right brain dichotomy turns out to maybe be a vast oversimplification of things. So please don’t get too hung up about that. What is important to note here is that there are in fact areas of the brain that do focus on one function or the other. In particular the section of her brain that kept track of boundaries was impacted. She no longer felt separate from the world

Interconnectedness: Taylor emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, including the brain’s hemispheres and how they shape our perception of reality. She highlights how her stroke led her to a profound sense of unity and connection with the world.

Present Moment Awareness: Her experience taught her to live more fully in the present moment. The stroke’s impact on her cognitive functions made her acutely aware of the fleeting nature of time and the importance of appreciating the present.

The Power of the Mind: Taylor reflects on the brain’s incredible capacity for healing and transformation. Her recovery underscored her belief in the mind’s power to influence physical and emotional well-being.

Compassion and Forgiveness: The experience deepened her understanding of compassion and the importance of forgiving oneself and others. She learned to embrace a more forgiving and empathetic perspective on life.

Transcendence and Awareness: Taylor’s altered state of consciousness during the stroke led her to explore and appreciate higher states of awareness and the potential for spiritual transcendence.

Overall, Taylor’s spiritual learnings focus on a greater understanding of interconnectedness, the importance of living in the present, the healing power of the mind, and a more compassionate approach to life.
 
And when you really feel it all the way, then the thing that wants to happen, organicity, just flows. Back to that now.
