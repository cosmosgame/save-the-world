## Save The World Books

This is a list of the books that have a plan to save the world. There are surprisingly few of them. Most are not well known.

### [Community](https://www.peterblock.com/books/community-the-structure-of-belonging-2nd-edition/)  

[Peter Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Block#Books) works with communities to help them find their voice and power. This book is a guide to what seems to work the best. Val Hammel is using this as a guide to how she can revitalize HAI and make it flourish. She thinks the way to save the world is to rebuild our communities. I strongly agree with her.

The book is a little heavy on theory early on. Val recommends skipping ahead to where Peter gets into concrete examples first to better understand what he is saying. It probably would have worked better if Peter had flipped the order of the book. First give the examples of communities he has worked with and then later on talk about theory.
